They can overheat, require a lot of stopping and starting in order to scrape down the sides, and often fail to blend ingredients to a smooth consistency even if you add more liquid and blend for a long time. Good design can help minimize these issues, but nothing makes a blender more effective than simply having more power.\n\n Blenders with higher wattage tend to be more expensive than weaker models, but they can handle tough ingredients and thick consistencies well enough to produce velvety smoothies, silky nut butters, and sleek sauces. Some can even make hot soups—using either a built-in heating element or the power of friction produced by blades spinning at high speeds—and many offer connected smart functions and self-cleaning programs.\n\n There's no official standard as to what constitutes a high-powered blender, but we tested dozens of them and found which ones get the job done.\n\nPowerful\nDishwasher-safe\nInexpensive (for a Vitamix)\nSmall pitcher\n Vitamix has long been considered the gold standard of high-performance blenders and is still the brand favored by many professional chefs for its power, design, and durability. Its blenders are expensive, but their incredible performance and durability make them worth the high price tag.\n\n The Explorian range is Vitamix's new entry-level blender, offering high power at a more manageable price. It's still not cheap, but it's hundreds less than the brand's flagship Professional Series. In our head-to-head testing of Vitamixes, the Explorian performed just about as well as the rest. Its 1,400 watts of power breeze through smoothies, sauces, dips, hot soups, doughs, nut butters, non-dairy milks, and more. What most impressed us, however, is how easy it is to clean: Add a drop of dish soap and hot water, then run for a few seconds. (This even worked after making sticky peanut butter!)\n\n The control panel here is very basic, offering 10 different speeds and a pulse function but no preset programs. The 48-ounce pitcher, made of heavy-duty, BPA-free plastic, is a bit smaller than some of our other picks as well, but it's dishwasher-safe.\n\n Capacity: 48 ounces | Power: 1,400 watts | | Speed settings: 10 | Dimensions: 11 x 8 x 17 inches\n\nSuper-smooth blending\nApp-controlled smart programs\nCan blend and cook\nVery expensive\nIncompatibnle with older Vitamix accessories\n Vitamix's top-of-the-line model is only a tiny bit more powerful than the Explorian above, but it's a heck of a lot smarter and quieter. The Ascent comes with 10 speeds and five on-board blending programs, plus wireless connectivity and the Perfect Blend app, which lets you control the blender from your phone as well as download new programs for all sorts of specific recipes.\n\n We put the A3500 through its paces and found amazing results with smoothies, peanut butter, whipped cream, cheesecake batter, potato pancakes, and mayonnaise—this is a really versatile machine. Maybe the most impressive thing it can do is cook food: The blades can spin so fast that the friction heats up the contents of the jar. It can bring soup to steaming in about 10 minutes, and we used it to make a smooth, lump-free chocolate pudding even faster than on the stovetop.\n\n There are a bunch of useful Vitamix Ascent accessories available, too. These include a food processor, a container for milling grain into flour, a special aerating blade for whipping cream, shaking cocktails, and making emulsified sauces and dressings. There are also small bowls and cups you can use to take a smoothie or dip to go. And the machine senses the attachment automatically, adjusting its settings and options accordingly.\n\n But then there's that eye-watering cost. This is a super-powerful luxury blender, sold for a luxury price. (If you're planning to upgrade from another Vitamix model, you should note that older attachments are not compatible with the Ascent series.)\n\n Capacity: 64 ounces | Power: 1,440 watts | Speed settings: 10 | Dimensions: 11 x 8 x 17 inches\n\nSmall footprint\nMultiple portable cups\nInexpensive\nOnly one speed\n Personal blenders are smaller in capacity than full-size models, but this one really isn't much less mighty. When we tested personal blenders, the NutriBullet Pro 900 crushed the competition—along with a lot of ice—and we named it our best overall pick. It comes with two 32-ounce cups, each big enough for an extra-large smoothie and with separate handled and flip-top lids.\n\n The 900-watt motor on this machine is less powerful than the rest of this list, but when it comes to small-footprint personal blenders, that's a lot. It had no problem breaking down and fully incorporating berries, kale, frozen banana, and peanut butter in testing, all within 60 seconds. It's also super-easy to use: Push the cup into the base, twist, and it locks and turns on. Twist the cup the other way, and it unlocks and turns off. The cups and lids are dishwasher-safe, and the removable blade unscrews for easy washing by hand.\n\n The NutriBullet Pro 900 is perfect if you're a daily smoothie drinker looking for a smooth and delicious breakfast. On the other hand, that's about all it can do. The single speed setting means you can only puree; don't try to achieve any kind of chunky texture. And the small capacity limits its usefulness for larger meals.\n\n We love, though, that it is cheaper than other high-powered blenders on the market but much smaller and ultimately easier to clean. Throughout testing, we've also found that it is very easy to store right on your countertop since the base is tall and lean.\n\n Capacity: 32 ounces | Power: 900 watts | Speed settings: 1 | Dimensions: 7.7 x 12 x 15.9 inches\n\nInexpensive\nGlass jar\nBonus portable cup\nNo tamper included\nLimited speed and program options\nNot very durable\n This Oster model offers high power and quality at a very affordable price. It has a 1,200-watt motor that can tear through tough ingredients like kale, and comes with a heavy-duty glass pitcher that’s dishwasher-safe and resistant to thermal shock. As a bonus, the blender comes with a 24-ounce plastic cup that screws right onto the blade base for a quick and easy single-serving smoothie to go.\n\n On the downside, it has only three speeds (low, medium, and high) and three preset programs (smoothie, milkshake, and salsa). For this price, however, it's also pretty replaceable. (If you'd like an even more multipurpose version of this machine, you can spend a bit more a get the Oster Pro 1200 with a food processor attachment.)\n\n Capacity: 48 ounces | Power: 1,200 watts | Speed settings: 3 | Dimensions: 7.3 x 8 x 14.3 inches\n\nHuge capacity\nVery powerful\nDurable\nExpensive\nNoisy\n Blendtec is a family-owned, U.S.-based manufacturer that produces ultra-powerful blenders beloved in professional kitchens. (You might know it from the \""Will It Blend?\"" series of viral videos that use its robust motor and blades to reduce things like golf balls and iPhones to dust.) This household model features a 90-ounce jug, big enough to make six smoothies all at once. It's made of BPA-free plastic and is dishwasher-safe.\n\n With 1,560 watts of power, the Blendtec Classic is the second-mightiest on this list. The motor can create hot soups through friction alone, and the unit has five speed settings plus four pre-programmed cycles. While it is expensive, this is a blender that can handle anything you throw at it. It's incredibly quick and effective, albeit a bit noisy. If you regularly make smoothies for large groups, large batches of soup, silky sauces or dips for entertaining, or icy blended cocktails, this workhorse of a blender is a solid investment. You could even use it to pulverize home electronics, though we wouldn't recommend that.\n\n \""I got this blender at a thrift store (best thrifting find of my life), and even though it had been used for an unknown number of years before me, it stood up to years of heavy use in my kitchen,\"" Katya Weiss-Andersson, Small Appliances Expert for The Spruce Eats, says. \""I was a professional chef developing recipes every day and couldn't have gotten by without it.\""\n\n Capacity: 90 ounces | Power: 1,560 watts | Speed settings: 5 | Dimensions: 8 x 7 x 15 inches\n\nInexpensive\nCooks and blends\nMany preset programs\nDifficult to clean\n Some high-powered blenders have a special soup mode that warms up the contents of the jar using only the friction generated by the high-speed blade. This one goes even further, with a built-in heating element that can cook food before, during, or after blending. The Ninja Foodi Heat-iQ features a 1,400-watt blending motor and a separate 800-watt heat source for precision control. It includes an impressive array of preset programs that let you throw in some raw ingredients, press a button, walk away, and come back later to a ready-to-eat soup.\n\n With the heat turned off, this machine is a beast of a blender, with a large jar able to handle smoothies, cocktails, sauces, and all the other things the other blenders on this list can. The heating element is incorporated into the pitcher itself, which makes cleaning a bit complicated—you can't really put it under running water in the sink. However, the blade and innards have a nonstick coating, and there's a self-clean function that needs just water, a few drops of dish soap, and the included brush to work. Another plus, though: The blender also comes with a tamper.\n\n Capacity: 64 ounces | Power: 1,400 watts | Speed settings: 3 | Cooking programs: 12 | Dimensions: 8.8 x 7.9 x 17.9 inches\n\nExtremely high power\nFairly inexpensive\nVariable speed dial\nHand wash only\n Looking to open a smoothie window or frozen daiquiri shop of your own? This ultra-powerful blender could be the right choice. With a 1,800-watt motor, the Cleanblend can take on ice, kale, bananas, peanut butter, and any other tough ingredients. It also has a variable knob that goes all the way down to low speed for gently chopping veggies into salsa. The precise controls let you crank the speed up and down evenly and get a very smooth result.\n\n With all that power, the Cleanblend carries an extremely reasonable price. It isn't the cheapest on our list, but it's close. The 64-ounce pitcher can only be washed by hand, which is a bit of a pain but not the end of the world.\n\n Capacity: 64 ounces | Power: 1,800 watts | Speed settings: Variable | Dimensions: 15 x 13 x 18 inches\n\nBuilt-in smoothie programs\nAirtight lid\nSmall capacity\nLoud\n With six speeds and programs specifically for crushing ice, making fruit-based smoothies, and making green smoothies, the Breville Fresh & Furious is the ideal machine for anybody who likes to drink their produce. Its special skinny blades break down fibrous ingredients into the tiniest of bits and can also whip air into the mixture for a rich texture.\n\n The Fresh & Furious features an extremely tight-fitting lid that ensures you'll never have any leakage or messy explosions. But it also has a unique pull-ring that makes it easy to remove when blending is done. The pitcher itself is printed with clear measurement markings, too, so you can pour all your ingredients directly into it, no other dishes required.\n\n If you're a hardcore smoothie-head, you should also check out Breville's Vac Q vacuum pump, which is compatible with this machine. It removes air from the pitcher before blending, which protects the ingredients from oxidation and makes for more vibrant colors and flavors.\n\n Capacity: 50 ounces | Power: 1,100 watts | Speed settings: 5 | Dimensions: 7 x 8.5 x 17 inches\n\nIf you're looking for a blender that can handle anything from making super smooth smoothies to grinding up nuts for nut butter, we love the Vitamix E310 Explorian Blender. For something a little cheaper but still able to handle lots of different consistencies and textures, we recommend the Oster Pro Blender With Glass Jar.\n For the past few years, we have conducted numerous blender tests both in our official testing Lab and in the kitchens of our experienced at-home testers. With each test, we evaluated the design, power, performance, ease of cleaning, and durability of every blender by making smoothies, soups, nut butters, and more.\n\nThe Spruce Eats / Russell Kilgore\n There's no official definition for how much power constitutes a high-powered blender, but anything over about 1,000 watts puts you into the top echelon of machines. The highest-wattage home machine we could find boasts 1,800 watts. (Smaller-capacity personal blenders don't need as much power to do the same job, making the 900-watt NutriBullet on our list one of the more powerful personal models out there.)\n\n Wattage is the most important determinant of power, but clever design features can help a blender do more with less. The number of blades, programs, spin speed, and pitcher shape also affect how well the machine performs. No matter how powerful a motor is, it can't chop ingredients that are stuck outside the range of the blade.\n\n The whirling, food-chopping bits at the bottom of blenders come in lots of different configurations, with different numbers of individual blades, in different shapes, set at different angles. A good blade needs to not only break up ingredients efficiently but also create a vortex that keeps everything in the jar mixing for consistent performance. In general, blenders that have larger blades arranged in an asymmetrical pattern, and a greater number of blades, perform better than those with fewer, smaller blades mounted parallel to each other, which can create a space below the blades for food to get trapped.\n\n Blender jars are pretty much limited to two materials: glass and plastic. There are pros and cons to both, and the best choice depends on your needs and preferences. Glass pitchers are heavier, but they are less likely to retain odors and stains. However, many high-powered blenders opt for hefty, BPA-free plastic, as glass can shatter at high speeds or if you add hot liquid to a cold jar. One minor issue with plastic is that blending hard things (like ice or nuts) over long periods can scratch the inner surface of the jar, making it cloudy. This is only aesthetic, though, and shouldn’t impact performance. If glass is your preference, look for a model that’s made from glass specially formulated to resist thermal shock.\n\n Some blenders come with tiny cups designed for single servings of baby food, and others can handle nearly a gallon at a time. Bigger isn't always better, as a huge jar can't blend a small serving evenly (and is likely to cost more). Your goal should be to choose a size that fits your personal needs. A small personal blender is perfect if you make a smoothie for one every morning, while a larger one would be better for a big family that's always whipping up multi-serving batches of soup. With large-capacity blender jars shape comes into play as well: Some are very tall and might not fit inside a cabinet, but there are also low-profile models that are shorter but wider.\n\n Blenders break food up into little tiny bits, which means there are always lots of little tiny bits of food to clean out of a blender. Some models have entirely dishwasher-safe jars and blades you can just throw directly in the machine, while others have to be carefully scrubbed out by hand. Many blenders split the difference, with a dishwasher-safe pitcher and detachable blade you have to wash by hand. It may also be possible to clean a blender by running it with soap and water inside; check your manual. No matter how you have to clean yours, try to do so soon after use—if food dries and sticks to the pitcher and blades, it's much harder to remove.\n\n One other very important rule: The motor base of a blender (or any other electrical appliance) should never be submerged in water or put in the sink. Use a damp sponge, cloth, or paper towel to wipe down the outside.\n\n When making smoothies and smooth soups, a tamper can be an important accessory that lets you safely push stubborn chunks toward the blades without having to remove the lid. Some blenders come with a tamper, while others offer them as an optional, sold-separately accessory.\n\n There's no official industry standard of how much power is considered \""high\"" when it comes to blenders. There are home machines on the market with as many as 1,800 watts and as few as 200. For the purposes of this story, we considered only blenders with 1,000 watts or more. (Personal blenders, with their smaller cups, don't need as much power as full-size machines. We made an exception for the NutriBullet Pro 900, as its 900 watts put it near the top of the range for personal blenders.)\n\n Ice is quite hard, and it needs blades spinning really fast to crack it into still-frozen fluffy snow. A lower-powered blender takes longer to crush ice, generating heat and melting more of it in the process. If you will most often be using your blender to make smoothies with ice or frozen fruit, you'll need one with a serious motor. Look for a blender with at least 1,000 watts and preferably more. But keep in mind that higher wattage generally means a higher price.\n\n A high-powered blender is ideal for crushing frozen fruit and ice, but this machine shouldn't be saved for just making smoothies and frozen cocktails. Use the blender to make waffle and pancake batter, sauces such as homemade hollandaise, creamy soups, fresh mayonnaise, salad dressings, dips, peanut butter, and sorbet. You can even use a high-powered blender to do the job of a juicer by blending up your produce with a little bit of water and then straining out the pulp with a strainer or nut milk bag.\n\n This article was written by Danette St. Onge, formerly the Italian Food Expert for The Spruce Eats and a features editor at Cook’s Illustrated magazine (part of America’s Test Kitchen).

Bisphenol A (BPA) factsheet.\n We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\n\nThree of the winners are from Vitamix.\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\nFor 10 years and running, the Vitamix 5200 has been our favorite blender for every task. Its powerful motor, analog controls, and tall, tapered jar help create a perfect vortex for silky-smooth soups, creamy nut butters, and purées.\n In this era of smart technology, you’d be forgiven for assuming the best cooking products are always the ones with techy upgrades and sleek interfaces. And while we do love intuitive features and multitasking appliances—like an air fryer toaster oven—there’s one highly useful kitchen appliance that needs no fancy bells or whistles: the blender. \n\n After 50 hours of testing 12 blenders across a variety of price points, our favorites were simple to operate, powerful, and designed for near-effortless efficiency. The oomph behind the motor matters, of course, but a lot more than that goes into creating a winning blender.\n\n The Vitamix 5200 outperforms every other blender time and time again. It excels at every task, turning hard, sticky, and fibrous ingredients into creamy purées. It’s powerful and can handle extended blending sessions without overheating. The 5200 features our favorite tall and tapered design that creates an optimal vortex, pulling ingredients into its blades. Its interface is refreshingly uncomplicated, too. It’s a true workhorse, lasting in our test and personal kitchens for years and years. \n\n Although similar to the Vitamix 5200 in many respects, the 7500 breaks the mold with its short, squat jar that fits nicely underneath an upper cabinet. It costs more than the 5200 and doesn’t have a turbo-charged “high speed” option, but it was a solid performer in every test, producing some of the silkiest soup and frothiest margaritas of the bunch.\n\n This blender’s jar capacity is a petite 48 ounces, but the motor is still mighty powerful. In addition to the 10 analog speeds offered in the 7500 and 5200, there are three presets: for smoothies, hot soups, and frozen desserts. The Propel 510 was an above-average performer at almost every task, and some cooks will appreciate the option to choose from four different colored bases.\n\n With six presets, the Total Blender Classic offers convenience. A digital display shows the countdown time, and you can always override the programs in favor of analog controls. Although we’d prefer a larger jar (this one is just 32 ounces), we did like the ergonomic design of the handle and spout. The Total Blender Classic excels at puréeing, making it a good choice for habitual smoothie drinkers.\n\n While it’s unlikely we’d ever describe a blender as “whisper soft,” this one did rank the best on our decibel test. It also has a generous amount of luxurious upgrades, including five presets (with two smoothie options) and 12 variable speeds. The wide-bottomed jar caused the Super Q to struggle a bit with creating a vortex, but the autoclean function and sleek-looking base were consolations.\n\nSerious Eats / Russell Kilgore\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n Jars with extra sides, ridges, or indentations are better at creating turbulence—a necessary ingredient to the all-important vortex that pulls ingredients down toward the blade and cycles them back upwards. A tall jar with a tapered bottom is even better at creating a vortex, and it will reduce unnecessary and inefficient splashing. On the flip side, a wide, shallow jar is easier to clean and scrape, and if you don’t plan on emulsifying sauces regularly, you may find that sufficient. A jar’s design matters when pouring, as well. Jars with long and trenched spouts were easier to pour from; wide, square-shaped spouts caused drips and spatters. We also considered how well the jar’s shape and size complemented the blade design.\n\nSerious Eats / Russell Kilgore\n Sharp blender blades may sound like a good selling point, but they’re actually a cause for concern. Not only do they present the potential for cuts during cleanup, but they also become dull quickly. Just one use with a hard ingredient, like frozen fruit, can cause the blades’ sharpness to be compromised. The blades on all Vitamix models are dull when compared to many other blenders (like the Breville on this list), but they’re hard to beat when it comes to performance and longevity.\n\n Also worth noting: All our winners had a four-blade configuration except the Blendtec. The optimal blade design features at least two blades that point upwards—even better if two point up, and the other two down. This allows food to cycle through the blades rapidly, with maximum blade contact. Ample space between each blade ensures that large pieces won’t get stuck or clog the works.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n We’ve appreciated presets since the dawn of the microwave popcorn button, but they’re not our main concern when it comes to blenders. Sure, a smoothie or hot soup setting is nice to have, but more important is the ability to choose from a wide variety of speeds. We prefer blenders that offer the ability to start slowly, and gradually work up to a rollickingly fast pace. It may take a little trial and error to dial in your blender’s most efficient speed/time combinations, but we think the learning curve is worth the greater control. Happily, even the preprogrammed blenders on our winners list all have analog speed settings.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n Here’s where the smart design features come into play. Although these elements didn’t make or break a model, they do make a difference in overall useability. We were excited by jars with clear lids that allow you to peer into the blender from above, and especially appreciated lids that lock for safe puréeing when working with hot ingredients. Tidy cord storage matters, and don’t underestimate the power of a flat-sided tamper that won’t ever roll off your counter onto the floor.\n\nSerious Eats / Russell Kilgore\n The best blenders have tall, tapered jars that create a vortex with ingredients when in use. Even better are jars with fluted edges or ridges, to increase the turbulence. Look for blenders with at least four blunt-edged blades: They will excel at crushing, pulverizing, and puréeing food. All high-quality blenders should have an analog control dial with at least 10 speeds. Preprogrammed settings for things like smoothies and hot soups are nice to have, especially if they align with how you most often use your blender. Although no blender operates silently, we favor blenders that don’t have grating, ear-shattering sound: Generally, anything under 88 decibels will be tolerable (although it’s worth noting that two of our winners do rank higher than that; it’s a tradeoff we were willing to make). Finally, consider size and weight. Heavy blenders offer greater stability but can be unwieldy to carry or move. Blenders with the tall jars we favor may be too tall to fit under some cabinets, so measure your storage and usage space before investing in one.\n\n What we liked: This blender is easy to use straight out of the box with just an on/off switch and a 10-speed dial. The lowest settings are peacefully quiet; in fact, it was the second quietest blender according to our decibel test. The jar, which is tall, narrow, and tapered, has four blades, and although they’re not oriented in the optimal up/down configuration, they’re spaced far enough away from each other to efficiently cycle ingredients. The wide base of this blender gives it a sturdy, stable feeling on the counter; we never feared it would tip or rock, even at high speeds. There is storage underneath the blender to wrap up the cord.\n\n The 5200 is powerful when blending hard and sticky ingredients. There was almost no pulp left behind during the almond milk test, and it blew the competition away in the smoothie test, with a beautifully smooth texture in just 30 seconds. It was also one of the most successful models at blending and cooking hot soup, with no signs of motor fatigue, even after six minutes at high speed. We especially liked that the “High” setting is a little more powerful than the tenth-speed setting, which allowed us to really juice up the motor for tough tasks. This blender is an incredible buy: An all-around solid performer for hundreds less than some we tested.\n\nSerious Eats / Russell Kilgore\n What we didn’t like: Other models performed better during the frozen margarita test. The 5200 left behind a large chunk of ice after blending. The rubber lid is opaque, and there is no locking mechanism (although it is a snug fit when clicked into place). At almost 10 pounds, the 5200 is heavy—but that does contribute to its stability.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n What we liked: This powerful blender was a solid performer in both the almond milk and smoothie tests, producing smooth liquids with little to no pulp left behind. The soup was creamy and sufficiently hot. We were blown away by the 7500’s ability to turn ice cubes into a frothy, slushy margarita in under 15 seconds.\n\n The pour spout is surrounded by a channel, which cuts back on drips and splashes. The jar is shorter and wider than that of the 5200, which gives it an edge for cooks who want to store their blenders underneath or inside a cabinet. The jar’s edges are curved; which makes scraping around the sides easy. \n\nSerious Eats / Russell Kilgore\n What we didn’t like: The 7500 was the eighth-loudest blender we tested, with an average decibel rating of 89.7. The base and jar combined weigh a whopping 12 pounds. The lid is similar to the 5200: opaque, without a locking mechanism (that said, it’s worth noting that neither model leaked during testing). Unlike the 5200, there is no turbo-charged “high” setting.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n What we liked: The Propel 510 features 10 analog speed settings and three presets for common recipes: hot soups, smoothies, and frozen desserts. We especially liked the smoothie setting, which starts on low power for 10 seconds and then dials it up to high speed for another 45. The result was a very well-blended smoothie, with no visible flecks of kale at all. The four-pronged blade features two horizontal blades and two upwards-facing blades for maximum ingredient cycling. We enjoyed the texture of the frozen margarita, which was just slushy enough to melt on the tongue like cotton candy.\n\n At around nine pounds, this blender is easier to lift and carry than many on our list. There’s a handy cord storage, and the base is available in four colors: black, red, white, or gray.\n\nSerious Eats / Russell Kilgore\n What we didn’t like: The Propel 510 is a pretty loud blender. Ranking in eleventh place, it just eked out of the top ten loudest models we tested. Although the almond milk we made in the Propel 510 was creamy and smooth, there was more pulp left behind than in the 7500 and 5200. It didn’t emulsify mayonnaise as well as other blenders: the texture was slightly runny. The thoroughly blended texture of the hot soup came at a price: we noticed a burnt rubber scent after seven minutes of running the motor nonstop. The square-ish spout made pouring a little dicey.\n\nSerious Eats/Will Dickey\n What we liked: This blender is a steal for cooks who want expertly blended food at the touch of a button. There are six unique presets: smoothies, hot soups, whole juice, batters, ice crush, and even ice cream. The digital display shows which setting is currently in use, as well as a countdown timer. There’s also an analog setting, which runs for 50 seconds at a time unless manually stopped.\n\n The lid features a locking mechanism, although it did leak a bit during the hot soup test. Rounded corners made the jar easy to clean, and we felt confident pouring from the funneled spout. The tapered handle also added to the overall ease of maneuvering. The Total Blender Classic retails for a moderate price, but we’d quickly snap it up if we found it on sale.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n What we didn’t like: Cover your ears: at 91.1 decibels, the Total Blender Classic was the third loudest we tested. (One of our testers noted it sounded like “a leaf blower.”) The blade is just two-pronged, although the U shape rectifies some of the inefficiency. The jar, at 32 ounces, borders on being inefficient, especially if you like to batch cook. There’s no cord storage, and the base has a wide bottom, which could take up valuable countertop real estate. After making a runny mayonnaise with plenty of splatter, we determined this blender is better at puréeing and pulverizing than it is at emulsifying. The warranty is only two years.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n What we liked: With a decibel value of 82.1, this blender is as quiet as they come, and our top performer in that category. There are some luxe upgrades on the Super Q, including five presets. Soup, ice crush, and frozen dessert didn’t surprise us, although the option to differentiate between “smoothie” and “green smoothie” was an unexpected feature. The presence of both Cancel and Pause buttons is a helpful touch, and the LCD screen is clear and easy to read. This Super Q has an auto-clean function, which works very well.\n\n The 68-ounce jar is the largest of any we tested: It’s very useful for batch-cooking. A personal blender cup is included, and you can also choose to upgrade your package with Breville’s Vac Q, a vacuum attachment that sits on top of the jar and removes air for a smoother blend.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n What we didn’t like: All that power and finesse come at a cost: This blender is both pricey and heavy. The extra-wide base of this blender meant that the vortex motion was hard to achieve. We noticed this during the mayonnaise test, which came out runny and watery. Scraping the fluted ridges was difficult and the serrated blades present a greater potential for injury while cleaning and will get dull quicker.\n\nSerious Eats / Will Dickey\n Although not common, some full-sized blenders are sold under the moniker “smoothie blender;” these are designed to pulverize frozen fruit and leafy greens, and don’t have other features that make blenders versatile. More common are blenders with a setting or two specifically for smoothies. To throw another term into the mix, personal blenders are sometimes called smoothie blenders or smoothie makers; these are designed for single-serve smoothies you can take on the go. They’re typically less powerful, with streamlined interfaces. Our favorite personal blender is the Zwilling Enfingy.\n\n Blenders pulverize ingredients with rapidly turning blades, creating purées, emulsifications, and sauces. Juicers work differently by extracting liquid from fruits and vegetables, leaving behind the pulp. If you're looking for an appliance to make fresh juice, you will need a juicer: Here's our full review, In a pinch, you can blend fruits and vegetables and strain out the pulp, but the resulting liquid will be more fibrous than with a juicer.\n\n Some manufacturers say their blender jars are dishwasher-safe, but we advise against it. Vitamix cautions against the practice, too. The prolonged exposure to water and soap could damage the gasket or loosen the internal components. Some blenders feature self-clean settings, but you can achieve the same result by blending warm, soapy water, and then running a few cycles of fresh water through the blender.\n\n Vitamix has great name recognition and a solid brand reputation—and for good reason. Our favorite blender is the Vitamix 5200, and after testing just about every model they make, we’re impressed with their quality and power. We also really like certain models from Blendtec and Breville, two of which were included on this list.\n\n The first factor you’ll need to consider is price. If it’s within your budget to spend three or four hundred dollars, we recommend investing in a high-speed blender, which has a powerful motor, plenty of speeds to choose from, and clever design features. But there are still plenty of quality mid-priced and budget blenders. If you tend to make lots of smoothies, soups, or frozen drinks, you may value a model with presets. But if you’re already comfortable with using a blender and want greater control over the texture and temperature, a blender with just a variable speed dial will work just fine.\n\n  We recommend rinsing the container with warm, not hot, water after each use. Add a couple of drops of dish soap to the jar and fill it halfway. Then, secure the lid and start the machine on variable speed 1, slowly increasing to variable speed 10. Run on High for 30-60 seconds. Pour the contents out, rinse thoroughly, and air dry the canister upside down. The base can be wiped clean with a damp cloth.\n\nAdvertisement\nWe independently review everything we recommend. When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.

Her coverage includes grilling, kitchen knives, and cookware, just to name a few.\nA blender is the only machine in your kitchen that can produce a beverage from chunks of ice and fruit in less than 60 seconds. And no other blender we’ve tested since 2012 can reliably make silky soups, spoon-thick smoothies, and stable emulsifications like the Vitamix 5200. Yes, this model is pricey, but we think its powerful motor, nuanced controls, and long-lasting reliability make it worth the investment.\nThis high-performance machine is worth the investment if you use a blender regularly to make things like thick smoothies, pureed soups, or motor-taxing nut butters.\nAmong the models we tested, this Oster Versa blender provided the best balance of performance and price. It’s not as powerful or durable as the Vitamix 5200, but it’s a good model for people who use a blender only two or three times a week.\nThis blender makes even silkier smoothies than the Vitamix 5200. But its limited range of speeds and short tamper make it less effective for hot soups or nut butters.\nThis compact, 48-ounce machine is ideal if you use your blender only for the occasional smoothie, frozen drink, or soup.\nA jar that is tall and narrows at the base is the best at drawing ingredients into the blades, to create a strong vortex.\nExtra-thick purees can create an air pocket over the blades. A tamper will burst that bubble and keep ingredients circulating.\nA variable speed dial allows you to fine-tune the level of blending power for each recipe.\nPerformance blenders have enough power to turn frozen fruit into thick, silky smoothies—without any lumps.\nThis high-performance machine is worth the investment if you use a blender regularly to make things like thick smoothies, pureed soups, or motor-taxing nut butters.\nIn our tests, from 2012 to now, Vitamix blenders have always performed the best overall. The classic Vitamix 5200 is the only one we’ve tried that can make creamy peanut butter and also puree hearty soup without spewing molten liquid up the sides of the jar. It doesn’t have preset buttons, but among the blenders we’ve tested, it does offer the widest range of speeds—far wider than on the comparably priced Blendtec Designer 675.\nThis blender is a favorite in many (if not most) professional kitchens and juice bars. We’ve also found the Vitamix 5200 to be one of the most reliable and durable blenders we’ve tested, and if the motor burns out within the seven-year warranty period, Vitamix will promptly replace the machine.\nAdvertisement\nAmong the models we tested, this Oster Versa blender provided the best balance of performance and price. It’s not as powerful or durable as the Vitamix 5200, but it’s a good model for people who use a blender only two or three times a week.\nThe Oster Versa Pro Series Blender is the best among a breed of budget-friendly, high-powered models. Compared with similarly priced blenders, this 1,400-watt model offers more speed variations and runs more quietly. It’s also one of the few blenders that come with a tamper (for bursting air pockets in thick mixtures, like smoothies).\nThis blender is 17½ inches tall, so it fits better under a cabinet than most other high-performance blenders. We don’t think this is the absolute best blender out there, and it doesn’t compare to Vitamix blenders in power and longevity (we burned out our Oster after two and a half years). But it does have serious blending skills, a user-friendly design, and a solid, seven-year warranty. If you don’t want to throw down almost half a grand on a powerful blender, the Oster Versa is your best bet.\nThis blender makes even silkier smoothies than the Vitamix 5200. But its limited range of speeds and short tamper make it less effective for hot soups or nut butters.\nIf you’re not ready to spring for the Vitamix, and you don’t mind trading the Oster’s longer warranty for a little more power, go for the 1,800-watt Cleanblend Blender. The Cleanblend’s strong motor helps pulverize berry seeds and ice, creating creamier smoothies and piña coladas than even the Vitamix can produce. This model’s jar is made of thick, durable Tritan plastic and has a comfortable, grippy handle.\nUnlike the Oster Versa blender, the Cleanblend doesn’t have preset buttons and doesn’t offer much variance between the low and high speeds. In our testing, the Cleanblend’s motor has held up better than the Oster’s, and it’s still going strong after five years of regular use. But Cleanblend covers this blender with only a five-year warranty, versus the seven years of coverage from both Vitamix and Oster.\nThis compact, 48-ounce machine is ideal if you use your blender only for the occasional smoothie, frozen drink, or soup.\nNot everyone wants to spend $200, let alone over $400, on a blender. If you want a machine for whipping up the occasional sauce or smoothie, the KitchenAid K150 3 Speed Ice Crushing Blender is the best model we’ve found in this price range.\nWith its 48-ounce jar and low profile, the K150 is the smallest blender we recommend in this guide. It produced coarser textures than any of our other picks, and its motor isn’t nearly as powerful (so it’s more likely to burn out if overtaxed).\nAnother compromise you make for the price is with the warranty. Unlike our other picks, the KitchenAid K150 is covered for only one year. But this is a good, all-purpose blender that’s small enough to fit on the counter under most kitchen cabinets.\nAdvertisement\nI’m a senior staff writer at Wirecutter covering kitchen and entertaining. I’ve covered everything from chef’s knives to stand mixers, and I’ve had my hands on every blender worth testing since 2014. I also have a breadth of cooking and entertaining knowledge from decades of working in restaurants and magazine test kitchens. This guide builds on the work of Christine Cyr Clisset, now an editorial director at Wirecutter.\nFor this guide:\nLike all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I’m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\nOur favorite food processor is, as it has been for a decade, the Cuisinart Custom 14-Cup Food Processor. It’s a durable, no-frills kitchen workhorse.\nA countertop blender delivers the silkiest smoothies, daiquiris, soups, and sauces of any type of blender you can buy. It’s more versatile than a personal blender (which is intended primarily for making smoothies) because it holds more and can handle hot liquids.\nThis style is also more powerful than an immersion blender. An immersion blender is great for pureeing soups directly in the pot or making a quick mayo, but it doesn’t yield the velvety textures you get from a good countertop blender.\nHow much you should spend on a blender depends on what you’ll use it for. If you want a kitchen workhorse—a machine that can tackle everything from hot soups and sauces to thick frozen concoctions on a daily basis without burning out—our top pick, the Vitamix 5200, is the best choice.\nIf you don’t want to pay over $400 for the Vitamix 5200, and you don’t use a blender more than a few times a week, consider one of our middle-of-the-road picks—the Oster Versa or the Cleanblend. These blenders are ideal for people who don’t blend every day but who still want something with enough power to make a thick smoothie or the occasional motor-taxing spread, like hummus or nut butter.\nFinally, we recommend our budget pick, the KitchenAid K150, for folks who blend only the occasional smoothie or batch of margaritas.\nAdvertisement\nSince 2012, we’ve researched or tested almost every decent household blender available, from budget models starting at $40 to powerful, high-performance models topping out at $700. In all of this testing, we’ve found these criteria to be the most important:\nA tall, tapered jar and a strong motor. These are the two factors most responsible for creating a vortex that pulls food down around the blade, allowing the blender to process tough items like kale or frozen berries quickly without burning out.\nThe main downside to a tall blender jar is that the fully assembled blender might be too tall to fit under low-hanging cabinets. Blenders with wide, short jars are better for countertop storage, but you’re sacrificing performance for that convenience.\nHigh-quality plastic jars. All of our picks have jars made of BPA-free Tritan plastic, which is very durable. Many lower-end blenders don’t advertise the material their jars are made from, but many are likely polycarbonate, which is slightly more brittle than Tritan. Both materials will crack if heated too high, which is why these jars should not go in the dishwasher.\nWe understand that some folks prefer metal or glass jars. But you’d be hard-pressed to find a powerful blender with a glass jar because the combination can be dangerous. If you accidentally left something like a metal spoon in the blender and turned it on, the glass could shatter.\nStainless steel jars are durable but opaque, and we like to monitor the progress of purees and emulsifications from all sides—not just through the lid. However, if you want to avoid plastic, Vitamix, which makes our top pick, sells a 48-ounce stainless steel blending jar separately. We tested it, and it worked well—but it’ll usually cost you another $200.\nGood value and durability for the price. For many home cooks, the holy grail seems to be a $50 or $100 blender that performs like a $500 Vitamix. But that isn’t realistic. Starting at around $200 and up, high-end blenders—often called high-performance blenders—offer more power, and they produce much smoother textures. High-performance blenders also tackle tasks you’d never want to try in a budget-priced blender, such as making peanut butter or milling grains.\nThat said, there’s nothing wrong with opting for an affordable midrange blender to make the occasional daiquiri or smoothie. So we’ve tested blenders in a wide price range, with the understanding that, for the most part, you get what you pay for.\nA good warranty. The most common complaint we’ve seen regarding cheap blenders is that their motors burn out easily and their jars crack or leak. But even higher-end blenders can encounter burnout from excessive stress. That is why a long warranty is important, especially if you’re paying a lot for a blender. Our high-performance blender picks all come with warranties of five to seven years.\nA simple interface, with an on/off switch, a pulse button, and a variable-speed dial. Preset programs for making smoothies, mixing soups, or crushing ice can be great if you want to multitask in the kitchen while blending. But we’ve also found that these functions rarely deliver purees as smooth as when we control the speed and time with the manual setting.\nA well-fitting tamper to cut down on blending time. With a tamper (a small plastic bat that fits safely in your machine while it’s running), you can burst air pockets and push food toward the blade without having to stop the machine.\nThe only time using a tamper wouldn’t be helpful is with a cheaper blender. These models don’t come with tampers because they have weaker motors, and forcing frozen and thick mixtures into the blades is too much stress for them to handle without burning out.\nWe judged each model on how well it performed everyday tasks, such as making smoothies, as well as on more challenging ones, like whipping up mayonnaise.\nIn each blender, we made a thick smoothie packed with frozen bananas and berries, kale, and coconut water. We looked at each model’s ability to create a consistent vortex without taxing the motor or requiring additional liquid. We tasted the smoothies, and we strained them through a fine-mesh sieve to see how well the blenders had pulverized tough greens and berry seeds.\nA blender can be a useful tool for making emulsified sauces, such as mayonnaise, hollandaise, vinaigrettes, and Caesar dressing. So we tested each model’s ability to emulsify mayonnaise made with one egg yolk.\nTo see how the motors handled dense purees, we processed raw peanuts into peanut butter. With our finalists, we made rounds of piña coladas, to see how well the machines blended ice into slush.\nAdditionally, we noted how noisy each model was, whether any of them produced a burning smell while the motor ran, whether the jars were difficult to attach to the bases, and how easy it was to use the control panels.\nAdvertisement\nThis high-performance machine is worth the investment if you use a blender regularly to make things like thick smoothies, pureed soups, or motor-taxing nut butters.\nThe Vitamix 5200 offers the best performance you can get in a home blender. This model has been one of our favorite blenders since 2014, and it’s the classic Vitamix that has remained the standard for pro chefs and blender enthusiasts. It produced the most consistently good results across all of the tests, and this blender was the most delightful to use.\nThe Vitamix 5200 consistently blended more gracefully than any other blender. The combination of the jar’s shape and the motor strength created a vortex that pulled ingredients down into the blades with ease.\nIt also made some of the smoothest smoothies in our tests. Though the prize for the absolute smoothest drinks went to the Cleanblend Blender, the difference between drinks made in the Cleanblend and the Vitamix was marginal. The smoothie made in the Vitamix had just a few more whole raspberry seeds.\nThe Vitamix 5200 excelled at nut butters and mayo. This blender was the only model we tested that smoothly blended peanuts and almonds into butter. Other picks, including the Cleanblend and the Oster, spit bits of mayo up the sides of the jar and out the lid’s center hole. But the Vitamix kept the mixture moving smoothly and evenly around the base of the blade.\nIt had the best range of speeds. The Vitamix 5200’s low is really low, and this blender produces a noticeable shift as you advance through each number. This range of speeds made the Vitamix the best blender we tested for hot liquids: You can start at a lazy swirl and gradually increase the speed so that hot liquid is less likely to shoot up toward the lid. By comparison, on its lowest setting, the Cleanblend has a forceful start, which increases the chances of a painful eruption of hot soup.\nWe pitted a Blendtec blender against a Vitamix model in a series of head-to-head tests, and the winner was clear: Vitamix beat Blendtec every time.\nThe Vitamix 5200’s tamper helps it blend really fast. A tamper is essential for breaking up air pockets and pushing ingredients down toward the blade while the machine is running. By keeping the ingredients moving with the tamper, we were able to whip up a smoothie in less than 60 seconds.\nWhen we used models that didn’t have a tamper, we often needed to stop the blender to burst air pockets or scrape ingredients down the sides of the jar with a spatula. In some cases, we also had to add more water to the smoothie to get all of the ingredients to move around the blades. So it took longer to blend a smoothie in those machines—often with more-watery results.\nIts Tritan-plastic jar is sturdy and comfortable to hold. And in the five years we used ours in Wirecutter’s test kitchen, it also remained clear and free of cracks.\nIt’s easy to clean. Just blend 8 ounces of hot tap water with a couple drops of dish soap for about 30 seconds, and then rinse out the jar.\nAnd it’s quieter than others we tested. No high-powered blender could be described as quiet, but we found the Vitamix’s noise to be quieter than the roar of our runner-up, the Oster Versa.\nThe Vitamix 5200 is equipped with an automatic-shutoff feature. Should its motor overheat, this keeps it from burning out. In our experience, this blender should be able to handle a lot before it gets to that point. But if yours does shut off, it’s best to let the machine rest for an hour before you try to use it again.\nIt’s backed by a seven-year warranty. This softens the blow of spending $400 on a blender. According to Vitamix’s customer service, the approximate time between filing a claim and receiving your blender back in working order (or a certified refurb) is six to 10 days. For an additional fee, you can buy a three-year extended warranty for the 5200.\nIn 2022, we tested some attachments that are available (as separate purchases) for the Vitamix 5200: the Vitamix Personal Cup Adapter and a 48-ounce stainless steel blending pitcher.\nWe tested the Personal Cup Adapter package (which includes two 20-ounce double-walled blending cups with lids and an adapter fitted with blades) against our personal blender picks.\nThe Vitamix Personal Cup Adapter works just as well as the personal blenders we recommend. In our tests, it performed on a par with both models at pureeing vibrant kale pesto, silky date shakes, and thick smoothies.\nThe trade-off is that the tapered cup is small, with a capacity that’s 12 ounces less than the Nutribullet’s. And the bottom is quite narrow, so if you want to maximize the Personal Cup Adapter’s blending capacity, you need to be strategic about filling the cup (tiny fruit first, chunkier fruit later). By comparison, the Nutribullet has wide cylindrical blending containers that can accommodate large chunks of fruit and ice, no matter how you load them.\nIf you already own a 5200, it’s convenient to get the adapter instead of another standalone personal blender. But you have to weigh that convenience against the cost: Compared with our recommendations in our standalone personal blender guide, the Vitamix adapter is more expensive than our top pick.\nIf you’re looking for an alternative to a plastic jar, consider the Vitamix 48-ounce stainless steel blending pitcher. The advantages to stainless steel are that it doesn’t stain or retain smells. But the 48-ounce stainless steel blending pitcher has less capacity than the full-size, 64-ounce plastic container that comes with the 5200. And like other low-profile blending containers, the stainless steel jar also works best when it’s at least one-quarter full. That said, in our tests it easily blended a thick, 24-ounce berry-kale smoothie, with few seeds left whole.\nSenior editor Marguerite Preston has used her Vitamix 5200 on a weekly basis since 2019, and she says it’s held up great. Her family uses it mainly to make smoothies, herb-based sauces, and the occasional batch of oatmeal-banana pancakes.\nWe also used a Vitamix 5200 in our test kitchen for five years and had nothing but excellent results. It finally did burn out, but only after we put it through strenuous use over the course of many tests for this guide and others. Still, it easily outlasted the Oster Versa, and it made many more (and better) batches of nut butter and extra-thick smoothies before we pushed it to its limit. Since our Vitamix was still under warranty when it burned out, we contacted customer service, and the representatives promptly replaced it.\nI’ve also used a Vitamix at home for years, and it’s still my favorite household blender, period. I long-term tested our runner-up pick, the Oster Versa, for six months and noticed some glaring differences: The Vitamix can handle more without its motor straining, and the Vitamix’s tamper is much better than the Oster’s (which is really hard to get down in there).\nChristine Cyr Clisset, deputy editor and author of a previous version of this guide, said she finally bought herself a refurbished Vitamix 5200 after years of long-term testing various Wirecutter blender picks. Christine said the first five (or so) times she used her 5200, she noticed a slight burning smell while making her morning smoothies.\nDuring a call with customer service, she learned that when you’re blending a thick smoothie, Vitamix recommends that you start the blender at the lowest variable speed setting, and then immediately turn the dial to 10—while vigorously tamping at the same time. Christine had been starting on low and then very gradually increasing the speed, likely stressing the motor. She reports that the burning smell has subsided since she’s followed the advice from Vitamix.\nFor many people, the biggest issue with the Vitamix 5200 is its steep price. This blender is normally at least twice the price of our runner-up, the Oster Versa. But after years of testing and using the Vitamix 5200, we find that it’s more durable and overall more effective than any other blender we’ve tried.\nYou can save some money on a Vitamix if you opt for a certified-refurbished model. A certified reconditioned Vitamix comes with a five-year warranty (with an option to extend coverage three more years, for an additional $75).\nAt more than 20 inches tall, the Vitamix 5200 is a big appliance. It’s too tall to fit under some kitchen cabinets. If size is an issue, and you’re willing to give up some of the functionality you get from a tall, tapered jar, Vitamix makes other blenders (as mentioned below) that have a shorter profile.\nThe Vitamix 5200 doesn’t come with any presets, just a variable-speed dial. However, even though it’s nice to be able to press a button and have your blender run through a smoothie-making program, this is not really essential. You’ll probably stick close to your blender anyway, in order to use the tamper to get things moving, and it’s not hard to adjust the dial if you feel the need to. With this blender, it’s also easy to get good results without any presets.\nAmong the models we tested, this Oster Versa blender provided the best balance of performance and price. It’s not as powerful or durable as the Vitamix 5200, but it’s a good model for people who use a blender only two or three times a week.\nWe don’t think you can beat the value of the Oster Versa Pro Series Blender. This machine isn’t quite as powerful as the Vitamix 5200, but it is about half the price. And it beat most of the other blenders in its price range at making silky smoothies, purees, and blended cocktails.\nSmoothies made in the Oster Versa were much smoother than those made in other lower-priced blenders. But it doesn’t achieve the absolute smoothest drink textures you’d get from the Vitamix or the Cleanblend—it left whole raspberry seeds in smoothies and made a slightly grainy piña colada.\nThis blender made a decent nut butter and velvety puree, but it struggled with mayonnaise. Compared with nut butter made in the pricier Vitamix, the nut butter made in the Oster Versa was slightly crunchier, and it required at least two cups’ worth of nuts to blend properly. And when we made mayonnaise in this blender, we were able to make an emulsification only once out of four tries.\nWe found the Oster Versa easier to control than the similarly priced CleanBlend, thanks to its wide range of speeds. The Oster Versa’s low speed is sane enough that you can start pureeing a batch of soup without having hot liquid shoot up the sides of the jar. The Cleanblend, despite its variable-speed dial, seems to have only two settings: high and higher.\nUnlike our other picks, this blender has manual speed controls and preset programs for soup, dip, and smoothies. So the Oster Versa is more versatile than the pricier Vitamix 5200, which has only a manual variable-speed dial. To get presets with a Vitamix blender, you need to spend even more.\nThis blender’s tamper is a little too short and oddly shaped. Compared with the smooth, cylindrical tampers of the Vitamix and Cleanblend models, the Oster Versa’s tamper has three flat pieces of plastic that meet in the middle. Even so, it still sufficiently bursts air bubbles and helps move things like peanuts around the blades, so it’s better than no tamper at all.\nLike other high-performance models, this blender is beefy. Its base takes up 8 by 9 inches of counter space. But at 17½ inches tall, the Oster Versa fits better under most kitchen cabinets than the Vitamix or the Cleanblend, both of which are over 19 inches tall.\nLike the Vitamix 5200, the Oster Versa shuts off if the motor is in danger of overheating. If this happens, you should allow the blender to cool for 45 minutes before you run it again. Doing this reduces the risk of permanent motor burnout.\nShould it burn out, the Oster Versa comes with a limited seven-year warranty. This covers “defects in material and workmanship,” including the motor and the Tritan jar. The policy is about the same as the coverage from Vitamix, which offers a seven-year warranty on the 5200. In our experience, Oster’s customer service is courteous, and it quickly addresses any issues with a blender while it’s under warranty.\nKnow that the Oster Versa won’t deliver the longevity and performance of a Vitamix 5200. The Oster Versa’s hardware feels a little cheaper (which is understandable since it costs a good bit less than the Vitamix). And the Oster Versa’s biggest flaw is its durability: We found through personal experience that it can burn out after two to three years of moderate to frequent use. But Oster honors its seven-year warranty and is quick to send a replacement (we got ours in about a week).\nFor three years, we used the Versa to make smoothies and soup twice a week on average. And during that time, it never quit on us—though we occasionally detected a faint burning smell from the motor when we were blending thick smoothies. But the motor permanently died when we formally tested the three-year-old Versa again for our 2017 update: When we were one minute into blending the nut butter, the machine’s overload protection cut the motor. We should’ve let the motor rest for 45 minutes before restarting, but we let it cool for only 10 minutes before our second attempt—and that’s when the motor burned out completely. However, our blender was still under warranty, and Oster quickly sent a replacement.\nAdvertisement\nThis blender makes even silkier smoothies than the Vitamix 5200. But its limited range of speeds and short tamper make it less effective for hot soups or nut butters.\nIf you can live with less-nuanced controls (read: you don’t blend hot liquids often), and you’re willing to take a chance on a shorter warranty, the 1,800-watt Cleanblend Blender costs about the same as the Oster Versa and produces finer purees.\nThe Cleanblend Blender made the smoothest smoothies and silkiest piña coladas of all of our picks, including the Vitamix 5200. When we strained the Cleanblend’s kale-and-berry smoothie, hardly any raspberry seeds remained in our fine-mesh sieve.\nBut it’s not great for making soup. This blender kicks into high gear even at the lowest setting. In our soup test, it sent hot liquid shooting up to the lid.\nAnd mayo made in this blender was noticeably warm. That’s because the blender’s motor seems to produce a lot of heat. The Cleanblend was better at making mayonnaise than the Oster Versa, though.\nIn our tests, the Cleanblend Blender made the smoothest smoothies.\nSo far in our long-term tests, the Cleanblend Blender’s motor has outlasted the Oster Versa’s. In our 2017 testing, our four-year-old Cleanblend and Vitamix blenders both powered through two rounds of nut butter without quitting. The same test fried our three-year-old Oster Versa. That said, Oster offers a seven-year warranty on the Versa Pro Series Blender, but Cleanblend offers only a five-year total warranty.\nCleanblend will extend the warranty to a total of 10 years, for an extra $75. This is a great value when you consider that the blender, including a decade of coverage, still costs about $150 less than a Vitamix 5200. You’re not going to get the all-around great performance of a Vitamix for less than half the cost, but the Cleanblend is still a good value.\nHowever, Cleanblend’s customer service is reachable only by email or a form on its website. So that might not inspire confidence in some people. Both Vitamix and Oster have a customer service phone number that connects you to a representative.\nThis blender’s base takes up about the same amount of counter space as our other high-performance picks. (Our budget pick, the KitchenAid K150, is smaller.) And at 19 inches high to the top of the lid, the Cleanblend has just slightly more clearance under most kitchen cabinets than the Vitamix (which measures closer to 20 inches).\nSenior staff writer Michael Sullivan has used an older version of this blender in his home since 2017, and he said he’s never had an issue with it. He pulls it out about six times a month to make smoothies, sauces, soup, or occasionally emulsifications like mayonnaise. He has even crushed ice in it a few times, and he said so far it has never stalled.\nWirecutter writer Sabrina Imbler used the Cleanblend in their home for more than a year. They used it three to four times a week and never experienced stalling or burnout. Sabrina told us: “[My] only minor complaint is that sometimes the blender rattles a bit on top of the base, which makes me a little wary, but otherwise it’s great. I only use it for smoothies and mixed drinks, never any kind of nuts, but it pulverizes ice pretty quickly. It’s also the perfect size for two smoothies. I really like that it’s a dial as opposed to number buttons—easier to [crank] up if my stuff isn’t blending fast.”\nThis compact, 48-ounce machine is ideal if you use your blender only for the occasional smoothie, frozen drink, or soup.\nIf you blend only the occasional smoothie, daiquiri, or soup, you don’t need an expensive, high-powered blender. The KitchenAid K150 3 Speed Ice Crushing Blender will serve your needs.\nThe KitchenAid K150 performed okay when making smoothies and frozen drinks. As is true with most blenders around this price, with the K150 you need to add more liquid to get a continuous vortex; otherwise, you have to stop it a couple of times to break up air pockets. Overall, we were satisfied with the drinks we made in the K150. The piña colada was a little icy but not offensive. And the smoothie was what we’d expect from a good $100 blender: very drinkable, with whole berry seeds and tiny flecks of kale.\nThe K150 safely blends hot liquids, including pureed soups. That’s because when you turn the machine on, its blades automatically start slowly and ramp up to the set speed.\nWe were pleasantly surprised that the K150 could make a small batch of mayonnaise from one egg yolk and half a cup of oil. We didn’t think the jar’s wide, square base and relatively short blade span would emulsify such a small volume.\nAs the name indicates, this blender crushes ice. We’re not talking professional-grade, fluffy shaved ice, of course. But this blender will do the trick if you want to make a few snow cones on a hot summer day.\nThe K150 is lightweight and compact. This blender is perfect for those who want to store their blender in a cabinet. And it has a low profile (15 inches), so it can easily fit in the standard clearance (18 inches) between kitchen countertops and upper cabinets. But at 48 ounces, the pitcher is on the small side, and it lacks the comfy rubber-clad handle found on our other picks.\nThe KitchenAid K150 comes with a one-year warranty. It excludes accidents, drops, misuse, and abuse.\nAdvertisement\nIf you find that your blender is having a difficult time processing ingredients, don’t be afraid to be aggressive (within reason) with the tamper in order to get the mixture moving around the blades. Also, make sure the blender jar is at least 25% full. When you’re making a smoothie, the general blender-loading protocol is as follows: greens first, then raw fruits and veggies, frozen food, ice, and liquid last.\nTo limit the risk of hot liquids shooting out the top of a blending jar, always start on a low setting and slowly increase the speed (in general, presets do this automatically). Never fill the jar past the hot-liquid fill line. And for good measure, to limit the risk of the lid popping off, place a dish towel over it and use your hand to firmly hold down the lid while you blend.\nIt’s best to avoid putting blender components in the dishwasher. You’ll extend the life of the jar, lid, and tamper by hand-washing them with warm water and mild dish soap. If that seems like a pain, don’t worry. We have some tips on how to quickly clean your blender bits so you can get on with your day.\nIf you’re looking for a powerful and attractive blender: The KitchenAid Pro Line Series Blender is a good choice for the aesthetically minded cook. This stylish behemoth is meant to live on the countertop. And that’s a good thing because it weighs 22 pounds, so you won’t want to be lifting it in and out of cupboards. In our tests this blender created silky-smooth textures (albeit not quite as easily as the Vitamix 5200), but it wasn’t great at emulsification. After a few years of long-term testing the KitchenAid Pro Line blender, deputy editor Christine Cyr Clisset said she really liked it. Christine said she used the Pro Line every day to make smoothies and found the preset blending programs useful on busy weekday mornings. (She did admit, however, that she added enough liquid to her smoothies so that they blended without her needing to use a tamper.)\nIf you need speed and strength from your blender: The Braun TriForce Power Blender is a beast. When we tested it against other high-powered picks, the Braun TriForce yielded super-silky smoothies in record time—just under a minute. But we thought it blended almost too well—the smoothies we made were liquified and lacked the creaminess and sorbet-like body we got from smoothies made in our picks. This machine was so powerful that it shot bits of food through the hole in the lid. And in the five seconds it took to remove the tamper and replace the lid cap, it sprayed our countertop and backsplash with smoothie mixture. All that power does mean you can make a good nut butter, though. We like this blender’s backlit control panel, which includes a variable speed dial, six blend settings, and a pulse button. We think this model is good for the price—even if it is a little too powerful.\nIf you’re looking for a fairly powerful budget option: We’re impressed with the performance and price of the Nutribullet Full Size Blender. Like the Braun TriForce blender, this Nutribullet model tends to blend the body and creaminess out of a smoothie, yielding a more-liquified (yet admittedly smoother) smoothie than we got from our budget pick, the KitchenAid K150. The Nutribullet also emulsified mayonnaise on the first try. It failed our nut butter test, but we have yet to find a $100 blender that can pulverize nuts into a paste. Even though we’re impressed with the Nutribullet’s performance-to-price ratio, we found the KitchenAid K150 to be a much more elegant machine—in both performance and looks.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough we favor the Vitamix 5200 for its tall, tapered pitcher and simple functionality, we understand that some seeking this brand’s quality and blending power may have other priorities. If you strongly prefer presets, or you need a shorter jar that will fit your space, consider looking at other models.\nOver the years, we’ve tested our way through much of Vitamix’s product line. Here’s what we think about the models we’ve looked at so far:\nCompared with our top pick, the Vitamix 5300 has the same 64-ounce capacity and speed-control dial, but it lacks the 5200’s ultra-high-speed switch. We found that the 5300’s low-profile jar failed to maintain a vortex as well as the 5200’s narrow, tapered one. Also, for smaller volumes (2 cups and under), the 5300’s tamper didn’t reach down quite far enough to burst air pockets. The 5300 is part of Vitamix’s C-Series, which includes the 5200. So if you already own the 5300 and want to try the 5200’s tapered jar, you can currently purchase the jar for $150.\nThe Vitamix Explorian E320 is nearly identical to the 5300. A Vitamix customer service rep told us that the two blenders had the same motor base, jar, tamper, and functionality. The main difference between the two is that the 5300 has a small on/off switch located just below the control panel. On top of that, the E320 is available only as part of a package with two personal cups and an adapter.\nVitamix added the Explorian Series E310 variable-speed blender to its lineup in 2017. We decided not to test this model because we didn’t think it was a good value. Although it’s typically about three-quarters the price of the Vitamix 5200, the cost difference is directly proportional to the E310’s smaller blending jar (48 ounces versus the 5200’s 64 ounces) and shorter warranty (five years versus the 5200’s seven years).\nWe’ve also tested three of the four Vitamix Ascent Series blenders (2300, 2500, and 3500), and these models come with the low-profile pitcher. The Ascent blenders are the upper echelon of the Vitamix line, with updated features including digital control panels and built-in timers. Like all of the low-profile Vitamix blenders we tested, these Ascent models aren’t as graceful or effective as the 5200 at blending smaller volumes (though you can buy extra attachments for that).\nThe Vitamix Ascent 2300 blender has most of the same core controls and blending power as the 5300, but the 2300 features an updated control panel that includes a digital display with a count-up timer (which could be helpful for those who strictly follow recipes). The Ascent 2500 has the additional feature of three blending programs (smoothies, hot soup, and frozen desserts).\nThe Ascent 3500 has a couple of upgrades that set it apart from the 2000 models; these upgrades include a programmable countdown timer (which will stop the blender when the time is up) and five preset blending functions (the most of any Vitamix). Apart from those features, the 3500 performs similarly to other Ascent models.\nWe also tested the Ascent Blending Cup and Bowl Starter Kit (which you have to buy separately); it can blend and chop small amounts, and it’s meant to take the place of a separate personal blender. The Ascent models are equipped with what Vitamix calls Self Detect technology. Basically, the blender base recognizes the type of blending container and adjusts to the appropriate speed control.\nBoth the cup and the bowl work as intended—eventually. During our tests, it sometimes took us a few tries to get the 3500 blender base to recognize the cup or bowl. After the 3500 eventually complied, we were able to blend a thick smoothie in the cup and chop garlic in the bowl—both pieces performed well. But compared with personal blenders, the Vitamix blending cup is narrow and small, so you have to chop up large chunks of fruit to maximize its 20-ounce capacity.\nThe Zwilling Enfinigy Power Blender didn’t make it past our first round of tests. To get a decent, 20-ounce smoothie, it took us over two minutes of blending and vigorous tamping—enough to make my hand sore for two days after testing. The jar is too wide and the tamper too stumpy to accommodate smaller volumes—and we don’t even consider 20 fluid ounces to be “small.”\nThe KitchenAid K400 blender is more powerful than the KitchenAid K150, our budget pick—but not enough to warrant the price jump. And in our tests, the K400 wasn’t nearly as good at blending fibrous kale as the less-pricey Oster Versa and Cleanblend blenders.\nWe tested an older but similar version of the Blendtec Designer 650. While it killed it when making smoothies and blended drinks, its lack of a tamper limits its usefulness: It failed to make peanut butter (a tamper would have helped), and the preset speed for soup was frightening, with hot liquid flying wildly around the jar.\nWe tested the Blendtec Total Blender for our 2012 review but found that it couldn’t compete with the Vitamix we tested at the time. The lid felt flimsy, and the panel controls seemed cheap.\nIn our tests, the powerful Breville Super Q threw a smoothie up the sides and into the lid (and even onto my face, when I opened the cap to add more liquid). This blender pulverizes tough foods, but the Vitamix 5200 also does that—for less money and with less drama inside the jar.\nThe Cuisinart CBT-1500 Hurricane blender struggled in our tests. Making thick smoothies and peanut butter involved adding more liquid, a lot of starting and stopping, and banging the jar on the counter. Without the Turbo button of the Hurricane Pro (more on that just below), this model is just another middle-of-the-road blender.\nThe Cuisinart CBT-2000 Hurricane Pro performed similarly to the Cuisinart CBT-1500 Hurricane blender, except it didn’t make mayonnaise as well (we achieved emulsification on the third try only). We did find the Turbo button useful for creating a fine puree. But again, without a tamper to burst air pockets, this blender needed a lot of tending to produce uniform, smooth purees.\nThe Ninja Master Prep Professional did a decent job of making smoothies, mixing bean spread, and blending margaritas. But due to its design, this model is terrible for making mayonnaise (the motor is top-mounted, so you can’t drizzle anything into the jar). The stacked blades are also dangerously sharp, so they’re difficult to clean.\nThe Ninja Professional Blender 1000 didn’t perform well. The green smoothies we made had a weird, confetti-like texture. And our mayo was especially loose, which meant the blender was whipping in too much air. Every time we ran this model, we detected a strong, burning-motor smell.\nThe Waring Commercial Xtreme made notably smooth smoothies, and it felt substantial. But ultimately it didn’t perform better than our picks from Vitamix, Oster, or Cleanblend. If we were willing to pay this much for a blender, we’d go for a reconditioned Vitamix 5200 instead.\nThis article was edited by Marilyn Ong.\nAdvertisement\nThe Best Blenders (subscription required), America’s Test Kitchen\nAndrew Gebhart, Ry Crist, From smoothies to pesto to almond butter: 13 blenders reviewed, CNET, August 22, 2014\nLisa McManus, executive editor of equipment testing at America’s Test Kitchen, interview\nJonathan Cochran, author of the Blender Dude blog, interview\nJ.

Is it pure ability and cup quality? Or should other factors, including after sales support, resale value, machine reliability, and even how the machine makes you feel as a home barista come into play?\nFor the entire time I’ve run CoffeeGeek, this is one of the top questions from our readers and members, and via social media. It’s even more common than “hey, have you heard of that cat poop coffee?” or “what’s the best coffee in the world”.\nWhat is the best espresso machine of all time, for consumers? \nThe answer, of course, is entirely subjective. Based as much on opinion and personal preferences as it is on technology, ability and reliability of the machine. Because of this, I usually try to avoid answering this question, often deflecting it or redirecting the conversation to what’s really important in a home espresso setup (the grinder).\nIf I were put on the spot, my go to answer for a long time was always the same: the Kees van der Westen Speedster. Not only is that machine capable of producing five star espresso shots all day long, but it actually makes you feel kind of awesome while you’re doing it. You feel part of the process, but the machine’s unique ability and engineering deliver the goods as well. It is the true ultimate in a hand crafted, unique and individual espresso machine with character to spare.\nAfter owning the machine for a few months, I paired it up with a Verslab M3 grinder. This may be a boast, but I knew I was pulling better shots on the Speedster and Versalab than the finalist baristas at the World Barista Championship were doing in competition. This wasn’t because of my own skill. It’s because I had an espresso machine better than the WBC machine of the era. Ditto on the grinder. They were that good together.\nYou don’t see a lot of influencers online talking about the Speedster because, to be honest, Kees don’t got time for influencers. He very rarely sends out test machines for people to try and blog or youtube about. I suppose if Hoff asked him, he’d send him one (Jim does own a KvdW machine, just not a Speedster).\nI owned and used a Speedster for a decade (yup, I bought one of the first ones ever sold in North America), and that gave me the background and experience to label it the best machine of all time. But there is a caveat. Not only is the Speedster obscenely expensive (landed cost in the US is around $15–$16K now, incl taxes and shipping); it is one of the most expensive machines to own and maintain in a home environment.\nIn my 10 years of ownership, I spent, on service and maintenance, more than what I paid for the machine initially. A lot of stuff on that machine broke down and needed replacing, from the SSRs to the PIDs, and most of the 7(!!!) Parker solenoids. I even had to replace the preinfusion piston assembly at one point.\nAnd therein lies the rub. If you factor in literally everything about an espresso machine, including initial cost, ability, mechanics, reputation, features, build quality, how it makes you feel operating it, and operational cost, maintenance and service, well, the Speedster is not the best espresso machine in the world.\nTo this day, it pains me to say that. I sold the machine three years ago, and I still miss it. A lot.\nThen there’s the La Marzocco GS3, which would normally be my very close second choice as the best in home espresso machine in the world after the Speedster. But sadly, when all things are factored in, it too is not the best machine you can buy today.\nThe GS3 is an absolutely landmark, ground breaking, standards setting machine. It was the first machine developed (not sold, but developed) with PID controls. It was the first true dual boiler machine to run on 110V with no real compromises. It was the first successful home machine to have a rotary pump running on a 110V setup.\nThe GS3 also has La Mazocco’s unique saturated group design (KvdW machines sort of copy it, to be fair). The steam ability is off the chart. It had the ability to run on an economy mode (which still seemed like full power) on 110V 15A, but if you plugged it into a 110V 20A circuit (most kitchens have this), it would go into full throttle mode. \nAnd it produces absolutely amazing, super consistent and temperature stable shots of espresso. All day long.\nI was involved in the development of the GS3 machine; indeed, I still own one of the late prototype versions. It’s sitting on a workbench in our basement, and I still fire it up once in a while. Here’s what it looks like:\nI’m on my third production La Marzocco GS3, and it sits in our kitchen as I type this.\nThird? Yup, because like the Speedster, the GS3 is finicky, had some early build issues, and continues to be a machine that requires a lot of expensive service. Let me walk you through my own history with the GS3.\nI bought, at a discounted price, a very early production unit back in 2007 (no, La Marzocco did not give me a free one, despite me being involved in the development); that machine lasted about 4 years with me spending about $2,000 on service calls on it past the one year initial warranty. It was a problem machine with a lot of early build quality issues.\nLa Marzocco USA agreed to swap it for a paddle version around 2011 (which wasn’t available in 2007) though I was charged a one time $1,000 premium to get the GS3 MP variant. That unit also turned out to be really bad (basically a dud, but I won’t go into all its issues with leaks, failing parts, pressure issues, etc), so La Marzocco swapped that one for another model in 2014-2015, provided I drove the dud one down to Seattle, to pick up the new unit to bring back to Vancouver.\nI did that. And since then, that 2015 MP GS3 machine has seen about $2,400 in service maintenance, and a one time $2,000 cost to upgrade it to the new Strada pressure control paddle group (which comes standard with the current GS3 MP models). All told, my ownership of a La Marzocco GS3 has cost me an initial investment of $6,800 (that’s $10K in todays’ dollars), and another $7,500+ in service, maintenance and upgrades.\nIn good faith, I cannot ‘proclaim’ a $7,500-$9,000 machine as the best in the world in the consumer espresso space if the maintenance, service, and parts prices end up costing as much as the initial machine purchase inside of a decade. I mean, La Marzocco charges $400 just for the drip tray pan on the GS3 (which is just plastic wrapped with thin steel, and a few screw on lock claps). And $250 for the drip tray cover! Don’t ask what the replacement tray for the Speedster costs: you cannot afford it.\nAs a side note, I suggested to La Marzocco, way back in 2004 when I was involved in the development, that they include an AppleCare+ like package for GS3 owners. Pay a yearly fee (I suggested $150 back then, though I guess $250 today would be more appropriate), and get unlimited service and support on the machine. Caveat is, owners can only buy into it within the first year of ownership, then keep paying it every year to stay in the program.\nI feel this would make La Marzocco a ton of money, but also save SOME GS3 owners from a lot of repair, maintenance, and service costs. Of course, La Marzocco did not do this. Perhaps because they were aware of the service LM GS3s require a few years down the road.\nBut I digress. We were talking about the Best Espresso Machines in the World.\nIf we are to pick the best espresso machine in the world, every factor about the machine is equally important. I listed most in the Speedster section above, but to reiterate, it includes: the quality of the materials and parts used in the machine; the build quality; the usability factors; the featureset overall; the noise it makes; the machine’s aesthetics; how it makes you feel in ownership; and of course the drinks it outputs. Equally important are the various cost of ownership categories: bang for buck, service costs, after sales service and support from the vendor or manufacturer, parts costs down the road, and resale value. \nWith all these factors in mind, there’s two machines that I think stand out as the best machines in the world, in the consumer espresso space.\nOne is the Lelit Bianca V3 espresso machine. The other may surprise you. It’s the Breville Bambino Plus.\nWe are midway through our full review process on the Lelit Bianca, and every single day I become more and more impressed with this $3,000 machine. I don’t like the phrase “end game” and how it is so casually used in coffee influencer circles, but I recently learned something about the Lelit product lineup as a whole, and the Bianca in particular that have pushed it over the top into what I think is a true end game machine. \nFirst of all, pretty much everything the La Marzocco GS3 paddle group machine can do, the Bianca can do in a package costing almost 2/3rds less. And even more so. The Bianca has three independent pressure modification systems on it; two are programmed automatic modes, and the third is a completely manual control. The Bianca’s PID system isn’t as granular as the GS3 is (which can go down to 0.3F adjustments), but it is smarter and more modern than the GS3. The Bianca, like the GS3, can be plumbed in, and attaching this machine to your home water line increases the ways you can play with pressure profiling, more so than the GS3 allows.\nThen there’s what comes with the machine. The only thing missing is a steam pitcher, a scale, and cups. The Bianca comes with wood accents and parts and knobs and feet (that can cost you up to $500 more on the GS3); it comes with the complete direct plumbed in parts (so does the GS3); it comes with four IMS filter baskets. It comes with two portafilters: the beautiful spouted model, and a chopped unit (the GS3 comes with only one PF). The Bianca also comes with a very high end tamper, matched to your machine’s wood accents (La Marzocco gives a stock tamper with the GS3; fancy matched wood is extra).\nTo get a similar package with all the extras when buying a La Marzocco GS3, you would spend about $10,250 ($9,500 plus another $750 for the extra stuff), making the Bianca close to 1/4 the cost.\nThings I learned about Lelit this year really push the Bianca to the top. You may know that Breville bought Lelit recently. Starting in January, they revoked the (previous) sole importer’s exclusive control over the brand in the USA, and are now directly handling distribution, sales, service and support. Even better, they are migrating Lelit’s after sales service and support to the Baratza team (which Breville also owns), and bringing Baratza’s parts availability and pricing system to Lelit. \nThat means if you buy a Lelit machine today or in the future, you will get Baratza style after sales service, support, and parts pricing. Absolute game changer. LM may charge you $250 for a drip tray cover, but if you want a new one for your Bianca, my guess is you’ll probably pay a fraction of that cost for it. New solenoid valve? Cost plus small handling charge. I bet they’ll even have new body panels available for the machine, at a very reasonable cost.\nAnd one more thing happened. With most companies of high end espresso machines, the painted or limited edition colours are a premium price on top of the base models. La Marzocco charges $450 for custom colour choices on the GS3 (plus another $500 if you want upgraded side panels). Lelit was that way with the Bianca: the base steel unit was $3,000, and the premium white or black models were $200 more.\nBreville decided to make them all $3,000 as of January of this year. (they also reduced the price on all other Lelit espresso machines, sold through their website).\nFor $3,000, you are getting an incredibly advanced, extremely high end, generational machine that is absolutely state of the art. It isn’t perfect (we noticed more than a few things we’d like to see updated in the Bianca, which I’ll save for our review). But in terms of ability, engineering, robustness, parts used, features available, consistency in the cup, steaming ability, recovery times, pressure controls, accessories included, technology inside, parts availability, maintenance costs (yes, all of this), there is literally not a better machine available today for the home espresso enthusiast. \nUnless of course $3,000 is just an unfathomable number for you for a home espresso machine.\nWhich brings us to…\nI know, crazy right? But when you think about it, for about $450 or less, (sometimes way less), the Breville Bambino Plus gives you a machine with the following:\nSure, the Bambino Plus has plenty of issues (the cup tray never heats up, the drip tray is pitifully tiny, the grouphead doesn’t heat up, necessitating a couple of blank flushes before a shot pull), but when you factor in the machine’s ability, consistency between shot pulls, instant on ability, steaming ability, temperature stability, parts availability and the absolute massive bang for the buck it delivers…\nThis is a candidate for the best espresso machine of all time. Because you could easily spend double the amount, buying a Profitec (Go), or Lelit (Victoria), as just two examples, and not get better espresso. You’ll get more robust, less plastic machines, but they also don’t have the technology the Bambino Plus does. I’d argue both machines don’t even steam nearly as well as the Bambino Plus does, automatically.\nAt the standard $500 price point, this is an excellent machine. If you can get it on sale for $450 or less, it is “the best” by a stretch in this price range.\nAs you can guess, this is all subjective. I’m sure my picks for the best espresso machines in the world won’t match what others pick. I always feel dollars play a very important part of the equation. \nI owned two of the machines that most pundits would pick as the best consumer espresso machines ever made (and continue to own one of them). I absolutely loved working on the Speedster. It made me feel very different from how I feel pulling a shot on a Bambino Plus. But that machine was a serious financial black hole. The GS3 is as well. \nTime will tell if the Lelit stands up to decades and decades of use where the overall service and maintenance is under $150 a year, averaged out over a decade or two. I think that’s a reasonable price to pay. Think of it as the strata fees you’d pay for a condo. The news I heard about Lelit going forward, following the Baratza after sales service model really pushed it over the top for me. \nThis is also why I haven’t mentioned the Decent Espresso machine yet. Many would pick that as the epitome – the toppermost of the poppermost – in espresso machines. I cannot. Though it is clearly one of the most advanced espresso machines you can buy today, it is also the most complex espresso machine available today. A gazillion parts inside, all needing to function correctly for the machine to work at full potential. \nDecent is a tiny, almost cottage industry company. I’d make the guess that La Marzocco sells more GS3s in a year than Decent has sold in their lifetime. Service and support is really good, right now, but if the company dissolves down the road, owners of Decent machines might be left with an extremely expensive brick at some point.\nFor that main reason, and the potential for the machine to be an even more expensive money pit than a Speedster or GS3, I cannot consider it as the best machine you should buy. \nLelit is a massive company by comparison, and has a nationwide (in the US) service and support infrastructure being built right now, which will be as good as the service in Europe already is. They also have 35 years of sales and support to stand on.\nAnd the Bambino Plus? I dare you to find another machine anywhere near its price point with its ability and tech inside. If it’s not the best espresso machine of all time, it’s certainly the best bang for the buck machine that’s ever existed. And for many, that also makes it the best, overall.\nIf you enjoy and learn from this resource, please consider making a one time or recurring donation to help support our work and fund purchases for future reviews.\nThis is a very intriguing article. I especially like to focus on after sales service and support. I’ve long admired the La Marzocco GS3 from a distance, but learning the realities of owning such a bespoke, custom and hand built machine (and specifically the service costs) is a reality check. This article made me dive a bit into La Marzocco Home’s website, and I’m shocked at the prices they charge for various accessories and parts. I do hope your prediction that Lelit will become a lot more serious about after sales support, and the prices on parts and accessories comes true. I see Lelit is on a big sale right now. There may not be a Bianca in my future, but the might be a Victoria or Mara!\nThank you so much Mark for this very informative article. Wondering if you would investigate how to improve the flavour factor (looking for richness/body) with the bambino plus.  I had no idea where to start with espresso and bought a delonghi  but was not happy with  lack luster flavour (i’m used to turkish grind with stove top bialetti).\nYou are so right about BP’s excellent features but i’m wondering if is,  in part, because portafilter is 54 mm as opposed to standard 58mm of more expensive/commercial  machines? I’m thinking to buy baratza sette 270 as it is on sale. Have been using  blade grinder shaking it as it is grinding and i am getting a consistant med fine grain( i have backed off from fineness so time of shot  is ~ 25 sec and I pick out any larger uneven bits.  I was also thinking of  the mini lagom . I’m also trying to suss out machines 500 to 1300 with 58mm and can be serviced in vancouver  bc. \nThanks again for providing an excellent website.\nThe 54mm portafilter is the least issue amongst those you’ve listed; a really good grinder, even the Encore ESP, SK40 Turin, DF54 or DF64Gen2 and the Lagom Mini for sure will vastly improve the espresso a Bambino Plus will produce. I’d concentrate on a) a good grinder, b) using good filtered water, c) sourcing good coffee, then work on your skills.\nThe 54mm portafilter can hold up to 18g in the basket, which is more than enough for a nice 45-50g double shot that is well balanced and tasty.\nInteresting that both your top machines are Breville brands.  I’ve owned two Brevilles – their original dual boiler machine (paired with a Compak K3 grinder), and currently an Oracle Touch.  Both machines have been unreliable money pits.  The dual boiler machine (I actually had two as the first didn’t work when I received it, so Breville replaced it) had multiple leak problems over the 4 years I had it and Breville stopped servicing those machines.  So they offered me a good discount on the Oracle Touch.  I spent ~$750 on the Touch last year because of internal leaks and bad solenoids causing the thing to go crazy even when turned off, and now it’s broken again with similar sounding issues (I’m not a tech type guy and wouldn’t dream of taking it apart to see what’s wrong).  I’m currently waiting for the box to ship it back to Breville for a repair quote.  And to be fair, Breville’s customer service has been good.  But I do worry about the reliability of everything Breville.\nNow, if the Bambino Plus has a problem after a few years, I guess it’s cheap enough to just get a new one.  But that’s contributing to the throw-away society we’ve become, which seems wrong.\nA couple of notes.\nFirst, Lelit is now owned by Breville, but they are still built, designed and entirely managed by the same team and company that they have been for 20 years; and their machines’ reps are pretty solid.  So I feel really comfortable recommending them. The fact they are being moved over to Baratza’s after sales support team starting in 2024 was the kicker. \nSecond, I have a Dual Boiler BES800 model from 2012 that is still functional today and has, according it its service menu, 8200 shots pulled on it. I have had to replace some gaskets on the steam boiler, and replace the pump once. For most of its life, I have used filtered water with it. Replacing gaskets is fairly trivial, even for those who are uncomfortable with removing the main body panels and diving into the machine. It’s no where near as difficult as doing, say a heating coil replacement in one of the boilers. Most of the “leaks” you find in most espresso machines come from these gaskets. I’ve had to do the same kind of work on long-used Rancilio Silvias, my La Marzocco GS3, the Speedster, two different Gaggia Classics, a Profitec 400, and several other machines. This isn’t an exclusive issue with Breville machines.\nThird, I have a BES820 model from 2016 that we use as our lab test machine, and that has 714 on the shot marker, which means it has pulled 7140-7150 shots. I have replaced gaskets on the steam boiler’s probes twice on that one, and the grouphead gasket twice. It has used filtered water its entire life.\nA good friend of mine in Ottawa has a BES820 that had leak problems starting about 2 years after he started using it. Got it serviced. Leak problems showed up again about 18 months later. We had a lot of back and forth (because I recommended the machine to him) and finally figured out he wasn’t using the water filter included, or better filtered water afterwards. Where he’s at, the water is particularly hard. The water he used ended up shortening the life of his machine and the parts. I pulled a few strings, and he got a good service deal on the machine (I don’t want to go into too many details) but he has used filtered water ever since (the BWT system). In four years since, his machine hasn’t had any leak problems or other issues. \nSo my main question to you is, were you using filtered water? Because Breville sells literally 100s of thousands of these machines every year, and their return rates are, last I looked into this (around 2019) are lower than the high end industry average.  They have been actively working since 2014 or so to improve their parts service, and after sales service (getting an Oracle Touch for $750 is a pretty amazing deal, all things considered that is below their US delivered cost).  Their improved after sales service is another reason why I said the Bambino Plus is a serious machine to consider. \nFor you to have  every one of your Breville machines fail seems an outlier, and possibly a user-end issue, not problems with the Breville machines themselves.  Be totally honest: what’s your local water supply like, and were you religious about using 100% filtered water (or even better, water designed to prevent scale build up, like BWT’s systems). \nI don’t do enough in our past reviews to absolutely stress the importance of good, filtered water for espresso machines. (I plan on changing this). Think about what they go through, compared to an auto drip machine or a kettle, or any other water heating device for coffee brewing. Espresso machines go through literal torture compared to those other devices, and bad water will definitely shorten their lifespans.\nWe take a deep look at the history and development of pour over coffee, from Melitta Benz to the Harios of today.\nThe CoffeeGeek website gets a complete overhaul and design update for 2024, making the site faster, more responsive, and more accessible.\nMore big ticket coffee and espresso gear is bought in the last 40 days of a year, than the rest of the year combined.

If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\n\nMy top picks come from Breville, Rancilio, and Diletta.\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\nOur favorite espresso machine is the Breville Bambino Plus. It's easy to use and has excellent temperature consistency. We also highly recommend the Breville Barista Express Impress, which has a built-in grinder and tamping arm.\n Brewing espresso is like the world’s quickest science experiment. You pull a shot, taste it, change a variable, and then make another shot—and this all happens in just a few minutes. But while you can tweak virtually every element when making espresso (the grind setting, the type of coffee, the shot time), you're not going to be able to change the machine you're using easily (or cheaply). And since an espresso machine is an investment, I (with my 15 years of experience in the specialty coffee industry) want to help you pick your investment wisely.\n\n To put together this review, I asked experts to weigh in on what they look for in espresso machines and how they communicate coffee tips and tricks with a broad audience. I also tested 25 espresso machines, with both experts and beginners weighing in on their experience to see which models made the best espresso, steamed latte art-worthy microfoam, and were easy to use.\n\n Compact, quick to heat, and easy to use, the Bambino Plus is a Serious Eats longtime favorite espresso machine for beginners and enthusiasts alike. It has tons of user-friendly details, and its temperature-stable boiler pulls great espresso shots. It also has an automatic steam wand that can create microfoam that’s silky enough for latte art.\n\n With a built-in grinder, an automatic coffee portioning system, and an assisted tamping lever, the Barista Express Impress streamlines the shot-pulling process so anyone can make great espresso. It has the same temperature-stable boiler as the Bambino Plus, and its steam wand was ready in seconds.\n\n The Rancilio Silvia has been a favorite of home espresso enthusiasts for over two decades. Built with commercial espresso machine parts, it pulled some of the best-tasting shots of espresso during testing (though it required a little technique). It also has a powerful steam wand, though it does take a little time to heat up when switching to steam mode. There are also online communities entirely devoted to the Rancilio Silvia, making it a great option for espresso enthusiasts.\n\n A quiet, rubber-mounted pump and a digital temperature control board make the Diletta Mio a nice upgrade pick for people who are serious about their espresso. It has a built-in timer, a side-mounted water reservoir for easy access, and a fast-heating steam wand for instant milk frothing. This is a great machine for anyone who makes multiple shots of espresso every day and wants on-demand steam pressure.\n\n An upgrade of the Barista Express Impress, the Barista Touch Impress has the same coffee portioning and assisted tamping system, only with a touchscreen drink menu that provides step-by-step instructions. It has the same automatic steam wand as the Bambino Plus, and its built-in grinder also has an upgraded burr set made by Baratza.\n\n Breville’s high-end dual boiler model pulled some of the most consistent shots back-to-back in my testing. I also loved its powerful steam wand that can be used while pulling a shot. For professional performance paired with Breville’s user-friendly touches, the Dual Boiler is a pricey but excellent pick.\n\n This Italian-made espresso machine is a stunner. It easily pulled quality back-to-back shots, had a temperature configuration button to tweak extraction for different roasts, and had an insulated steam wand that stayed cool to the touch when frothing milk.\n\n One of our longtime winners, the Gaggia Classic Pro offers commercial components in a compact and moderately priced espresso machine. Like the Rancilio Silvia, the Classic Pro is beloved by home espresso enthusiasts who enjoy tinkering, and it pulled great shots during my testing—though it required some boiler purging technique for stable brewing temperatures.\n\n While I didn’t love this espresso machine, it’s the only model under $200 that I thought did a good enough job for the home espresso curious. I struggled steaming microfoam but was able to pull some passable espresso shots with it. If you’re not quite ready to take a full dive into espresso as a hobby, I think this machine offers a lot of value. \n\n If you want a home machine that can power a small coffee shop, the Lelit Elizabeth gets the job done in spades. It has a dual boiler for simultaneous shot pulling and powerful steam pressure, digital temperature, pre-infusion control, and a heavy-duty stainless steel body. Like the MaraX, it’s a splurge, but the Lelit Elizabeth delivers.\n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n It's tricky to weigh taste, value, and usability the same for every user. “I advise considering what your needs are first and foremost,\"" says Steve Rhinehart, e-commerce manager at Acaia and former brand manager at Prima Coffee Equipment. \""Do you want to cut out the cafe expenses from your budget? Are you already interested in coffee and want to expand your hobby? What kind of drinks do you like—straight espresso, flavored lattes, flat whites?” \n\n Folks who are after a great espresso shot and don’t mind tinkering might be happy with a lower-priced model that can be modified, like the Gaggia Classic Pro, but cappuccino lovers might want to step up their game with a dual boiler machine like the Breville Dual Boiler, which lets you steam milk while your shot is pulling. If you don’t have any professional barista experience, however, a user-friendly model might be a better choice, like the Breville Bambino Plus for its automatic steam wand or the Breville Barista Express Impress for its assisted tamping lever.\n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n Espresso machines have a boiler that heats water and a pump that then pressurizes that water through a finely ground and tamped espresso puck. The fineness of the grind and the pressure from the pump produce an espresso shot that’s around eight to 10 times more concentrated than standard drip coffee and has a syrupy thick body from emulsified and suspended coffee oils. A good espresso machine gives the user consistent pressure and keeps water in its boiler at the optimal 195ºF to 205ºF range. \n\n One of the features we paid close attention to when testing espresso machines is pressure. If you’re not incorporating pressure into your brewing, you’re essentially just making strong drip coffee. As 2007 World Barista Champion James Hoffmann explained, nine bars of pressure is optimal for espresso because it extracts the flavors and concentration you want from your coffee without overly compacting the espresso puck, which hinders extraction. Most home espresso machines use a similar vibrator pump to create this pressure, and the best espresso machines are designed to regulate that nine bars of pressure as it flows through the coffee for even extraction. (Coffee percolators deal with extraction issues, too).\n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n The way to think about water temperature and extraction is that hotter water will extract more flavors from coffee faster, while colder water will pull flavors from coffee more slowly. A coffee brewed with very hot water (over 205ºF) can be over-extracted and thin while a coffee brewed with colder water (under 195ºF) can be under-extracted and sour. Most espresso machines have a single boiler that switches between brewing and steam mode, and the temperature in the boiler can swing as high as boiling (212ºF) and as low as 185ºF depending on the heating cycle. Other espresso machines use a thermoblock, which flash heats water on demand for brewing or steaming. High-end machines, however, will have two boilers: one dedicated for brewing, and one dedicated for steam (this is the case for the Breville Dual Boiler).\n\n Before we get into the testing nitty-gritty, here's a brief, non-exhaustive overview of some commonly used espresso terms:\n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n I tested machines that cost between $200 and $2,000 and, for the most part, they were all able to pull a great shot of espresso. However, the more expensive and commercial-grade the machine became, the easier it was to get the coffee quality I wanted. Pricier dual boiler machines like the Breville Dual Boiler made dialing in the right grind setting a breeze due to their consistent pressure and high-quality design. \n\n Similarly, I loved the espresso shots we pulled on the “prosumer” Diletta Mio Espresso Machine, Rancilio Silvia, and Gaggia Classic Pro, but it took a little more trial and error adjusting the grind to get the shots that we wanted. Lastly, the Breville Barista series (including the Breville Bambino Plus and Breville Barista Express Impress) uses a lower-pressure “pre-infusion” that gently saturates the espresso puck, which helped me find a good shot quicker but took a little longer to nail the flavors I was after. So while investing in a high-end machine might make your daily espresso routine smoother, casual home espresso fans can still find a great option that fits their budget without sacrificing quality. \n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n Espresso machines with a PID (proportional integral derivative) controller to manage their brew temperatures pulled more consistent shots than machines without one. And while most of my top picks come with an integrated PID, the Rancilio Silvia and Gaggia Classic Pro do not. That means that the boiler temperature on both of those machines can swing between 185ºF to 210ºF, leaving some shots tasting sour and others bitter. There are ways around that, though—you can temperature-surf both machines by purging water to trigger a heating cycle and pulling your shot at a set time after the boiler light turns back on (with detailed instructions for the Gaggia shown here). Once I was able to work out the routine, these machines pulled incredible espresso shots on par with $10,000 commercial models—it just took a little extra work. People who love to tinker can also order an aftermarket PID kit and install it themselves, but those modifications will void the warranty. \n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n Both the Breville Barista Express Impress and Breville Barista Touch Impress have convenient built-in grinders that pull great espresso shots, but their grind range was more limiting than using a standalone espresso grinder. I loved the Barista Express Impress’ automatic dosing and tamping system for how streamlined its shot-pulling process was, but was able to pull better-tasting shots with a Breville Bambino Plus, and our favorite espresso grinder, the Baratza Sette 270. The Touch Impress comes with an upgraded set of grinding burrs manufactured by Baratza, which improved the espresso quality but was still limited in the number of grind settings that were in the ideal espresso range. (Its touchscreen system, however, was clutch for walking espresso beginners through the steps necessary to make a latte or cappuccino.) \n\n In summary: While espresso aficionados might want the freedom a standalone grinder provides, the average coffee drinker will likely appreciate the built-in grinder on either of these models. \n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n Unless the espresso machine had a dual boiler, most machines had steam pressure that was just adequate—but that isn’t a surprise. To produce silky microfoam that’s capable of pouring latte art, espresso machines need powerful steam pressure to whip air bubbles into the milk and create a vortex that breaks those bubbles down until they’re microscopic. A dedicated steam boiler is the best way to have a constant supply of high-powered steam to create microfoam, and it’s no surprise the dual boiler models steamed the best milk out of all the machines I tested. \n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n Most home machines, however, use a thermoblock for flash-heating or have a switch for steam mode to superheat the boiler to over 240ºF. While I liked how handy the on-demand steam was from the thermoblock in the Breville Barista line and Dilettta Mio, it wasn’t as powerful as the steam pressure from the steam mode of the Rancilio Silvia or Gaggia Classic Pro. The downside for the Rancilio and Gaggia, however, is that it can take up to a minute for the boiler to get hot enough for steam pressure, making it inconvenient for anyone who likes making milk-based drinks.\n\n What really impressed me, however, was the automatic steam wand on the Breville Bambino Plus and Barista Touch Impress. Those machines have a temperature sensor and a variable air injection system that creates microfoam automatically and does an excellent job, making them a great option for latte lovers who want a no-fuss home coffee break. \n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n The best way to clean an espresso machine is to backflush coffee detergent up into the group head using a blank filter basket that doesn’t have holes. Typically, this means users have to run the machine in five-second on-and-off cycles manually so it can pressurize the cleaning powder into the machine and dispel it through the pressure relief valve in the drip tray. However, many of the machines I tested had cleaning programs that ran those cycles automatically. Even better were the Breville machines that had alert systems that told you when it was time to perform a full cleaning cycle. Since espresso machines are expensive, the best way to keep them running for a long time is regular cleaning and maintenance. It’s a small user experience perk, but for home espresso beginners, automatic cleaning cycles are a great way to make sure you’re taking care of your new machine. \n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n The best espresso machines pull great shots of espresso and can consistently deliver the same espresso quality shot after shot. They also have steam wands that are capable of creating silky microfoam, and they should be easy to clean.\n\n What we liked: The Bambino Plus is a compact and lightweight espresso machine—but that doesn’t mean it can’t hold its own against models twice its size. Instead of a traditional boiler, the Bambino Plus uses a ThermoJet heating system that reaches brewing temperatures in just three seconds. It also has a PID to ensure that the machine is brewing at exactly 200ºF with every shot pulled. The machine uses pre-infusion to saturate the coffee puck at a lower pressure during the first few seconds of brewing, which helped me dial in great espresso shots with just a few grind adjustments. Aside from its excellent espresso performance, the Bambino Plus is chock full of user-friendly details, like a bobber that pops up when your drip tray is full and the cleaning instructions printed on the back of the removable water reservoir. Combined with an automatic steam wand that has three temperature and foam level options, the Bambino Plus is an approachable machine for beginners and experts alike. \n\n What we didn’t like: The biggest gripe I have with the Bambino Plus is its automatic volume buttons for espresso. They weren’t as consistent as I would like them to be, so I suggest stopping your shots manually instead. \n\n Best for: Beginners and pros alike who want a feature-rich machine at an approachable price point. \n\n Recommended accessories: Breville includes all the accessories you need to make espresso with each machine, but I also recommend this upgraded IMS espresso filter basket for better tasting coffee, this Crema Coffee Tools distribution tool and push tamper for more level espresso pucks, and it never hurts to stock up on Cafiza Espresso Cleaning Powder.\n\n What we liked: Most Breville Barista machines are made with the same internals, so temperature stability and pressure ramping in the Breville Barista Express Impress are similar to the Bambino Plus. Both machines feature a flash-heating system with a PID that regulates temperature and a near-instantaneous switch to steam temperature. The truly amazing feature of this model, however, is the intelligent dosing system. By adding a built-in tamper, the Barista Express Impress can adjust the amount of coffee it automatically doses to the ideal 18-gram dose. Once the tamper is fully compressed, the gauge gives you immediate feedback if you need to add a little more coffee—or if it’s overdosed the filter basket—and the machine will auto-correct itself the next time it grinds. I found this super helpful during testing, where the machine pulled back-to-back shots consistently without me having to manually weigh out every espresso puck. Its built-in grinder was also easy to adjust.\n\n What we didn’t like: I still wish the grinder had more built-in settings—it offers 25 versus the 270 on the espresso grinder we used to test other machines—but it did a solid job grinding fine enough and consistently enough for most people at home. It also has the same automatic volume issues as the Bambino Plus.\n\n Best for: Anyone who is new to espresso or just wants a streamlined home experience. \n\n Recommended accessories: The Barista Express Impress is a one-stop shop, and it's likely other filter baskets wouldn't work with its dosing and tamping system, so my extra recommendation is the Cafiza Espresso Cleaning Powder.\n\n What we liked: A favorite of home baristas for over two decades, the Rancilio Silvia is one of the first home espresso machines ever made with commercial-grade parts. It’s heavy-duty with a fairly small body, and I pulled some of the best-tasting espresso shots on it during testing. While it doesn’t have a PID-controlled boiler, it has a light that indicates when the machine's heating so I could temperature surf for 200ºF brew temps. Its single boiler can be switched to hot water mode that dispenses out of the steam wand for pre-heating espresso cups, as well as steam mode. That means it has a more powerful steam wand than most of my top picks since it has a full boiler pressurizing the steam wand instead of a quick-heating thermoblock. The steam wand itself was a joy to use—it’s the same full articulating steam wand that Rancilio adds to its commercial machines, and combined with the weighted professional portafilter, using the Silvia felt like having a pro setup at home. \n\n What we didn’t like: It can take the machine a few minutes to heat up enough for steam mode, and then after you’re done steaming, the boiler will be too hot to pull a shot right away. It’s not an ideal espresso machine for anyone who wants to make back-to-back milk drinks, and I also found that nailing the temperature surfing process was tricky. You can add a PID to the machine, though, and you can even buy a version with a PID added for you.\n\n Best for: Espresso enthusiasts who don’t mind learning techniques or tinkering.\n\n Recommended Accessories: The VST 18-gram espresso basket is also an excellent upgrade that lets you grind finer for better-tasting espresso. This push tamper/coffee distributor combo from Crema Coffee Products is also handy for evenly distributed espresso pucks, and you'll need a milk steaming pitcher if you plan on making lattes. Finally, the best way to keep everything clean is with Cafiza Espresso Cleaning Powder and a cleaning brush.\n\n What we liked: The Diletta Mio is a newer model that’s designed to add high-end espresso machine functions with a more user-friendly interface. Its customizable PID controller lets the user adjust the brew temperature by a single degree Fahrenheit, and the display doubles as an automatic shot timer. It has a simple three-button interface for power, brewing, and steam, and you can even turn the steam boiler off if you want to save some energy. Its manometer dial on the front gives you real-time feedback on the pressure inside the basket while brewing. Its steam wand is powered by a separate thermoblock so steaming milk won’t affect your brew temperature, and this also means that steam mode kicks on in just a few seconds, like the Breville models I tested. When it came to performance, the Mio pulled consistent, fantastic back-to-back shots. \n\n What we didn’t like: The biggest downside of this machine is its price—though I think it’s worth it if you want a high-performance machine without having to take out a second mortgage. I also wish the steam wand was a little more powerful.\n\n Best for: Espresso enthusiasts who want high-end performance and don’t mind spending a little more. \n\n Recommended Accessories: It’s hard to go wrong with a VST 18-gram espresso basket upgrade, which lets you grind finer to extract more sweetness. The Mio doesn’t come with a milk steaming pitcher, though, so you’ll need to pick one up. And the best way to clean your machine is with Cafiza Espresso Cleaning Powder and a cleaning brush.\n\n What we liked: An updated version of the Barista Express Impress, the Touch Impress has the same auto-dosing and assisted tamping lever, only with a touchscreen system that walks you through every step of the espresso process. It was great getting immediate real-time feedback letting me know if the shots were too fast or slow and how to adjust the grind to achieve better results. With an upgraded burr set made by Baratza, I thought it pulled better-tasting shots than the Express Impress. The touchscreen can also walk you through every step needed to make a latte, and with the same automatic steam wand as the Bambino Plus, the Touch Impress is an almost entirely automated espresso machine that still lets you pull shots and steam milk manually if you’d like. I appreciated the built-in cleaning reminders and the automatic shot timer, too.\n\n What we didn’t like: It’s a machine with a lot of great technology, and that runs the price up for sure. It also has the same automatic volume consistency issues that all of the Breville models have. \n\n Best for: Anyone who wants a seamless drink-making process and has a large budget.\n\n Recommended accessories: The Barista Touch Impress comes with everything you need to start making drinks, so my only extra recommendation is the Cafiza Espresso Cleaning Powder.\n\n What we liked: On first impression, the Breville Dual Boiler was a step up from the competition. It has a professional-grade 58-millimeter portafilter, a pressure gauge, a PID display and shot-timer, and a hot water spout for preheating cups. Because it has a dedicated brew boiler and steam boiler, I was able to easily pull shots and steam milk simultaneously. When it came to espresso, the Dual Boiler pulled extremely tasty shots, and its boiler was so consistent that we could pull back-to-back espressos without any variation in quality. Plus, the steam pressure created textured microfoam worthy of any cafe. But while a lot of high-end espresso machines aren’t always user-friendly, the Dual Boiler is packed with details that make it excellent to use. Not only does the drip tray have a bobber to alert you when it’s full, but there’s also a hidden storage compartment to keep your cleaning tools behind it. It also has pop-up rollers so you can easily move it on your counter without having to lift the machine, and there’s even a magnetic divot to hold your tamper when not in use. These thoughtful touches make it a dream to use, and while it’s the second priciest espresso machine I recommend, it packs in features you’d normally see in espresso machines two or three times as expensive. \n\n What we didn’t like: It’s an expensive machine, and you still need to buy a standalone grinder. It also has the same automatic volume issues as the other Breville models I tested. Still, it’s hard to find a dual boiler espresso machine for under $2,000, and for frequent cappuccino or latte drinkers, I think you’ll appreciate the machine’s excellent steam pressure. \n\n Best for: Anyone who drinks multiple cappuccinos a day, has a bit of espresso experience, and wants a high-performance machine that’s easy to use. \n\n Recommended Accessories: The VST 18-gram espresso basket is also an excellent upgrade that lets you grind finer for better-tasting espresso. This push tamper/coffee distributor combo from Crema Coffee Products is also handy for evenly distributed espresso pucks, but otherwise, the Dual Boiler comes with everything you need to start making great espresso drinks.\n\nSerious Eats / Nick Simpson\n What we liked: This is, arguably, the best-made espresso machine of our winners. It pulls great espresso, is easy to dial in (it even has a temperature configuration for different roasts), and froths cafe-quality milk. I liked that the insulated steam wand stayed cool while on and that you could grip it while frothing and position it just so. There were small graphics above each function (like for the group head and hot water) that showed which direction to turn to engage them. The build quality on the Mara X’s tamper is much, much better than most.\n\n What we didn’t like: While this machine offered flawless performance, it’s very expensive. It’s also heavy.\n\n Best for: Enthusiasts and pros who want a top-of-the-line machine.\n\n Recommended accessories: I like this Crema Coffee Tools distribution tool and push tamper and you'll need to purchase a milk steaming pitcher.\n\n What we liked: A longtime favorite of Serious Eats, the Gaggia Classic Pro is similar to the Rancilio Silvia—it’s a single boiler machine made with commercial espresso parts that overperformed for its price point. And while it might not be the most user-friendly model out there, it pulled espresso shots that matched the quality of the most expensive winners. Similar to the Silvia, the Classic Pro doesn’t have a PID and requires temperature surfing to achieve 200ºF brew temps, but after pulling a few shots I felt pretty comfortable with the routine. Its steam wand was powerful, though it took a few minutes to heat up, and I was able to pour latte art on my second try. \n\n What we didn’t like: The temperature surfing process made it difficult to pull back-to-back shots quickly, and switching to steam mode and back to brew mode to make multiple milk-based drinks was a headache. Still, it pulled incredible espresso shots for its price point, and like the Silvia, you can add a PID and other modifications fairly easily. \n\n Best for: Espresso enthusiasts who like rolling up their sleeves, have a modest budget, and only make cappuccinos on occasion. \n\n Recommended Accessories: The Gaggia Classic Pro highly benefits from upgrades, including the VST 18-gram espresso basket, a sturdy tamper from Crema Coffee Products, and a milk steaming pitcher for making lattes. I also really like this dispersion block upgrade that’s made out of brass for better temperature stability and has a more precise screen for more even water distribution. And don’t forget the Cafiza Espresso Cleaning Powder and a cleaning brush—you’ll need them to keep your machine clean. \n\n What we liked: I didn’t love this machine, but for anyone on a budget, it makes adequate espresso. The shots I pulled with it were more passable than good, and its steam wand made bubbly, lumpy milk foam. Still, at a fifth of the price of the next cheapest machine, the De’Longhi Stilosa is a good value and outperformed every other model under $400. I also liked its dead-simple interface, which is a single dial that can switch to brew or steam only.\n\n What we didn’t like: Aside from its so-so performance, it’s also pretty flimsy with a mostly plastic body and rattled a lot while brewing. But, for its price, the Stilosa punches above its weight class. \n\n Best for: Anyone who is curious about espresso but not quite ready to take the plunge on more expensive equipment. \n\n What we liked: The Lelit Elizabeth is a serious espresso machine that made me feel like I was working in a professional coffee bar (again). It has dual boilers for independent brewing and steam functions, a pressure meter, and a digital PID display that lets the user customize brewing temperatures. And while its interface is more bare-bones than the Breville Dual Boiler, the Elizabeth pulled incredible shots and steamed pristine microfoam every single time. It also has a programmable pre-infusion setting for gently saturating your espresso pucks before the full pressure kicks in. There’s not much more to say about this product—it's a small espresso machine that delivers professional performance, and anyone serious about at-home espresso will love it. \n\n What we didn’t like: It’s very expensive, and at this price I expected it would come with better accessories. Still, the Elizabeth’s performance was more on par with professional-grade espresso machines that cost three times as much, and I think it offers a lot of value in the dual-boiler espresso machine category.\n\n Best for: Anyone who is dead serious about their espresso, wants unmatched steam pressure, and dreams about turning their kitchen into a coffee bar.\n\n Recommended Accessories: This machine comes with a plastic tamper, unfortunately, so I think you should invest in a push tamper/coffee distributor combo from Crema Coffee Products. I also think that the VST 18-gram espresso basket can help you step up your espresso quality, and you’ll need a milk steaming pitcher to take advantage of this machine’s steam boiler. As always, Espresso Cleaning Powder and a cleaning brush will help you keep your machine running smoothly. \n\n The nuances of cleaning an espresso machine will vary depending on your specific machine, so always check the manufacturer’s instructions first. In general, though, you’ll want to keep up with day-to-day cleaning tasks, like purging and wiping down the steam wand after use, flushing the group head to avoid the buildup of coffee grounds, and cleaning the portafilter and basket.  \n\n Again, check the manufacturer directives for details on descaling your particular machine, but this is a good habit to get into on a monthly basis—especially if you use your machine daily or if you live somewhere with hard water.\n\n Whether an espresso machine is worth the purchase or not is always going to be a personal decision. Consider your budget, counter space, and likelihood of frequent use. If you’re happy with filter coffee and only reach for an espresso beverage as an occasional treat, you’re probably fine to skip the at-home espresso machine. But if you’re dropping $6 on lattes each day from your favorite coffee shop? Well, an espresso machine might be a great investment.\n\n Espresso is a concentrated shot of coffee, extracted at high pressure from a compacted puck of extremely finely ground coffee. It's either consumed on its own or used as a base for a cappuccino or latte, which adds heated and aerated milk to the espresso in different quantities. Cappuccino is a smaller espresso and milk beverage, usually around five ounces, with a thicker layer of foam. A latte is a larger espresso and milk beverage, usually around 12 ounces, with a thinner layer of milk foam.\n\n The three main types of espresso machines are semi-automatic, automatic, and super-automatic. These terms refer to how much of the espresso shot-pulling process is controlled by the user or the machine itself. Semi-automatic machines require the user to grind their coffee, tamp it into a puck, and then start and stop the espresso shot manually. Automatic espresso machines also require the user to grind and tamp their own coffee, but they have a built-in volumetric system that automatically stops the espresso shot once it reaches the desired volume. Super-automatic machines will grind, tamp, and pull the shot to a specific volume all inside the machine itself. While super-automatic machines are very convenient, they don't offer as much control as semi-automatic and automatic espresso machines do, making it harder to fine-tune the quality of the espresso shot itself.\n\nFind anything you save across the site in your account \nAll products are independently selected by our editors.

As much as we have a general distaste for any product review that parses products into categories that are too narrow (“the best plastic-handled chef’s knife” or “the best coffee maker for left-handed people”), espresso machines are a little different. They can be vehicles for a passion project—learning to make coffee shop quality drinks, closely monitoring variables like brewing temperature, pressure, and flow rate. They can be a little luxury to use at the end of a dinner party that you have no intention of mastering. They can simply be the brewing process you’ve chosen to get your morning caffeine as quickly and easily as possible.\nEach machine will be a bit different in terms of what it requires from a home barista, and that’s why we’ve broken down our recommendations into several categories. But after working with more than two dozen we've identified categories that we think capture what most people are looking for in an espresso maker: coffee quality, ease of use, and value. Read on for our top picks, and for more on how we tested, and which machines just didn’t measure, scroll further down.\nAlmost all of the machines we’ve tested here (and most of the machines available at major retailers) fall into one of two categories: semi-automatic espresso makers and super-automatic espresso makers. Both of them are electronic machines that use motor-driven pumps to brew espresso. But the big differences tend to take place prior to brewing. Though not all semi-automatic machines have the same features—some have built-in grinders, some have integrated pressure gauges, some allow you to precisely adjust temperature—all semi-automatic machines require users to fill a portafilter and tamp the coffee grounds into a puck. On a semi-auto users also have to insert the portafilter into the group head, the place where water pumps out of the machine.\nSuper-automatic espresso machines do all those steps for you. Simply press a button and the machine will grind, tamp, brew and, often, even froth milk with no further input from you. While they are undoubtedly easier to use, super-autos generally don’t allow the kind of personalization that semi-autos do in order to get the exact flavors you want from an espresso shot.\nThere are also manual machines and we tested a couple. They don’t have electronic pumps and its up to users to produce the right amount of pressure, around nine bars, with their arms.\n\nLelit Mara X Espresso Machine\nSeattle Coffee Gear\nProsumer (that is, professional + consumer) is a portmanteau that could accurately describe a whole lot of elite-level home kitchen gear—Vitamix blenders come to mind—but it’s used quite often to refer to high-end home espresso machines. Some prosumer machines are scaled-down versions of the most sought-after commercial machines (see: La Marzocco’s Linea Mini). But increasingly there are just a number of companies focused on high-end home espresso makers as their own thing. Lelit, which was recently acquired by Breville, is one, and their MaraX didn’t just produce the best coffee of all the machines we tested, it was also the most stylish (don’t discount that in an immovable 41 pound piece of hardware).\nThe MaraX lacked some of the bells and whistles of some other machines, like a digital PID (the uninitiated can think of this like a very accurate thermostat that keeps the water at the appropriate temperature) or built-in timer, but this is where our tendency to focus our testing on real world results really showed. We can’t describe the espresso from this machine as anything other than luscious. Even without milk the drinks from the MaraX had a rich, velvety mouthfeel and they were bursting with flavor. The pressure ramps up slowly when you’re pulling a shot which gives a very controlled feeling to the whole process.\nSteaming milk likewise feels controlled. The steam wand doesn’t feel quite as powerful as some other high-end espresso machines we tested, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t just as effective. The full, smooth texture on both dairy and non-dairy milks made wonderful cappuccinos, lattes, and flat whites.\nThe MaraX uses a heat exchanger, which means there are separate lines for brewing coffee and generating steam, but only one boiler. If you’re looking to keep the price of a prosumer machine down, a heat exchanger is going to be your best option. It lets you brew and steam almost simultaneously, but it’s smaller, lighter, and less expensive than a dual boiler system, which has completely separate boilers for brewing and steaming.\nUnlike a number of other high-end machines, the Mara X allows you to brew directly into a mug thanks to its generous 4.5” cup clearance. This might seem like an exceedingly small thing, but while prosumer machines produce notably better espresso, they also come with very few design features that could really be called “convenient.” This is one. We’d note, however, that in order to make sure you’re pulling a shot of the right size you’ll want to slip a coffee scale under your mug, but that’s no problem as the Timemore Nano scale we used during testing fit easily.\nAnd even though it doesn’t have a digital PID like some of the other prosumer machines we tested, you can select between a few temperatures: 197℉ (warm), 201℉ (hot), 205℉ (very hot) and a dual pressure gauge shows both the pressure inside the boiler to let you know it’s ready to brew and the pressure at the group head to let you know you’re getting the kind of shot you want. You can also select between a coffee only mode for brewing back-to-back-to-back espresso shots, or a steaming mode that gives a little temperature boost after you pull a shot so you can go right over to start steaming milk. Either way you can make several drinks in succession with almost no down time.\nThe last thing we have to mention about the Lelit MaraX is its aesthetics. Prosumer machines have a tendency to look very industrial, primarily stainless steel peppered with black plastic. The Mara X is available with gorgeous wooden accents that make\nYou will have to wait a little while for your coffee. When it was cold the Mara X took about 18 minutes to heat up; you know it’s up to temperature when the heating light turns solid white. The machine is equipped with a sleep mode that keeps the water a bit warmer than room temperature, but even when heating from sleep it still took around 10 minutes before it was ready. This isn’t unusual amongst professional machines because they have larger boilers and more involved heating systems. Also, while we don’t consider this a real minus, making coffee with the Mara X is more involved than, say, a Breville machine and users should be ready to be more hands-on.\n\nBreville Bambino Plus\nAmazon\nBreville\nSeattle Coffee Gear\nIt's strange to say that a $500 appliance is a “budget” pick, but in the world of espresso machines, that is on the low end of what it takes to get quality espresso. Those machines you find in the $200-$300 range generally lack the pressure or temperature control to do a good job. Breville’s diminutive Bambino Plus though made huge improvements over earlier models like the not-tricked-out regular Bambino and Breville’s more expensive (and hulking) Infuser. For one thing, it heats up almost instantly; it goes from off to ready to brew in less than five seconds. It now comes with both single-walled filter baskets and double-walled filter baskets (also known as pressurized filter baskets). Previously it only had the latter which almost guarantee the proper pressure and good crema from a single or double shot even if you don’t tamp perfectly, grind your coffee beans too coarsely, or don’t have precisely the right amount of grounds. Pressurized baskets also work with pre-ground coffee (we don’t recommend using it, but if it’s your thing, you can with this machine). The addition of single-walled filter baskets will give people who want to experiment with the flavor of their espresso more flexibility.\nThe great triumph of this machine though, particularly for someone with very little experience using espresso makers, is its automatic milk steaming. You can set how foamy you want your milk, place the milk jug under the steam wand, push a button and just let it go. You don’t need to angle the jug or even hold it, it’s totally hands-free. And while a feature like this could be gimmicky, the texture of the milk was rich and smooth. We even tried the function with oat milk to see how it would handle something non-dairy and it gave more volume and texture than we got on any machine that cost under $1000.\nBreville has also rolled out a fix for one of the features we missed in the original model we tested: a hot water dispenser. Previously only available in models released in the UK and Australia, all Bambino Plus models can now get hot water from the steam wand by pressing the “one cup” and “steam\"" buttons together.\nThe bottom line: This is the most dummy-proof semi-automatic espresso machine we’ve used. There are some ways to manually adjust the Bambino Plus—you can set different brewing times and different water temperatures, you can switch from automatic milk steaming to manual—but you don’t need to touch any of them if you don’t want to. It’s got functionality that’s as simple to use as some of the truly entry-level beginner machines (which we do not recommend at all), but produces coffee drinks that are closer to a machine like the Solis.\nEven though it’s really not necessary with this machine, a pressure gauge would be nice. While it’s possible to get a sense of how the extraction is going by just watching the coffee come out, the information from the gauge is helpful. And while the automatic milk steaming is a really useful feature for beginners, it comes with a couple downsides: To accommodate the process, the steam wand doesn’t rotate the way it does on lots of machines in this price range, it just slides up and down like a lever. It also requires a little more milk than we typically use in our drinks to work correctly because the jug needs to have a certain volume in it to trigger a sensor. Finally, the wand auto-purges after use, which is nice, but it caused a small amount of milk to spray on to the counter.\n\nBosch 800 Series Verocafe with Attached Milk Container\nAmazon\nSur la Table\n\nBosch 800 Series VeroCafe Fully Automatic Espresso Machine with Detached Milk Container\nAmazon\nSur la Table\n\nBosch 800 Series VeroCafe Fully Automatic Espresso Machine with No Milk Container\nAmazon\nSur la Table\nChoosing a super automatic espresso maker over a semi-auto machine that gives you the ability to really dial in a shot is always going to be a choice of convenience over quality. But there are fully automatic machines out there that can make nice espresso and tasty milk drinks, and plenty of coffee drinkers who simply aren’t interested in tinkering with their coffee every morning. The Bosch 800 is the machine for them.\nBosch is new to the super auto coffee space as of 2024 and its first entries set a high bar. Its espresso was good–the same flavorful, if muted, crema topped shots we got from the Jura E8. But, we think the real purpose of a super automatic machine is to quickly and easily make milk drinks. And in this the Bosch really didn’t have a close competitor. It comes with 20 pre-programmed drinks including the common cappuccino and latte macchiato, and rare-for-an-automatic-machine options like a cortado. Through its Coffee World app you can also add more than a dozen more from around the world that offer fun tweaks to the classics, like the Austrian Weiner Melange, which is like a shorter, beefed up cappuccino. The most impressive thing about all these different drinks is how many of them seem, well, different. Cheap automatic machines will sometimes offer both a cappuccino and a flat white, but the latter is nothing but a cappuccino with less milk on top. We did notice a difference in strength, in texture, and in taste with a number of these drinks.\nCleaning was relatively easy thanks to automatic cleaning cycles for the milk system, the brewing unit, and the coffee dispenser.\nIn terms of accessories, you can choose an 800 Series with an attached milk container, a detached milk container, or no milk container at all. That attached milk container costs an extra few hundred dollars, but provides the easiest to clean and operate version of the machine.\nThe actual “coffee” setting, as in, the one you’d use if you just wanted a cup of coffee came out quite hot and tasted a little burnt. Also, while the “cold brew” setting, which takes about four minutes, produced a smooth, cold brew-esque like cup, the “slow brew,” which seems like the machine’s answer to pour-over, didn’t taste like much. As we said above, we think the reason to choose a super automatic coffee machine is for its ability to make milk drinks, so don’t less this dissuade you. If you do want an easy, regular cup of coffee though, go with a good drip coffee maker instead. It’ll save you a lot of money.\n\nWacaco Nanopresso Portable Espresso Maker\nAmazon\nOkay, hear us out here: When you dip this low in price on an espresso maker, you’re not going to get the same shot you would out of the Lelit Mara X or even the Breville Bambino Plus, but if you’re willing to use a little elbow grease, you will get good espresso and give up zero counter space. The Nanopresso is a 6x2\"" manual espresso machine typically marketed as a coffee maker for camping, hiking, or combatting bad hotel coffee, not unlike an Aeropress. But we found that the Nanopresso gives espresso makers even three times its cost a run for their money.\nThe tiny tool works by creating pressure through a piston pump: If you’re at home with a scale and a grinder, just fill the machine with 8 grams of freshly ground coffee, tamp it down with the back of the plastic scoop, and add 80 milliliters of water heated between 190°–200°F, then squeeze a button on the front of the machine repeatedly. Position your coffee cup below and a stream of espresso comes out of a small hole at the bottom of the little pill-shaped espresso maker. We were able to pull a shot with a decent layer of smooth crema on top. Tasted side by side with a shot from a Breville Infuser machine, it held its own, even if it had a bit less brightness than the machine-pulled shot. However, the Nanopresso was very forgiving. We made coffee as we might have to in the woods—water measured without a scale or thermometer, coffee measured with a spoon—and still got a shot that was much better than the $100–$200 espresso machines we tested for this review. If you’re making coffee with a Moka pot right now, you should definitely consider upgrading to the Nanopresso.\nAccepting this little gadget for what it is means adjusting expectations accordingly. Given that we didn’t expect it to perform to the level of a good semi-automatic espresso maker, there was nothing not to like.\nWe made dozens of espresso shots and more cappuccinos and lattes than it is comfortable for any one person to drink. On the semi-automatic machines we liked, we tried steaming oat milk in addition to full-fat cow’s milk. On the super automatic machines, we tried each of their brewing functions with whole milk and oat milk.\nThe first and most important criteria. Was the espresso balanced? Was it too bitter? We wanted to brew shot after shot that was nuanced in flavor, with some sweetness and brightness instead of an ashiness or bitterness.\nCan the wand pump steam and air into the milk to make a velvety, frothy texture? Inferior steam wands make giant air bubbles that quickly pop and only pump air into the milk, without incorporating foam consistently throughout. So we looked for a wand that made consistent, steamed milk.\nWater pressure and temperature must be consistent and the pressure shouldn’t be too high for brewing espresso. As we noted above, it is best made at a pressure of about 8–10 bars, and an ideal water temperature is around 200°F. Generally, the more expensive the machine, the better the equipment inside regulating these two factors. Almost all the machines we liked had PID controllers doing that work. A central problem plaguing inexpensive espresso machines (say, under $200) is that they lack a PID, meaning the temperature of the brewing water can fluctuate and yield inconsistent results. Inexpensive machines often advertise that they have 15 or 20 bars of pressure as a selling point, but higher pressure is not the priority, and too much pressure can actually lead to over-extraction and bitterness in an espresso shot. Therefore, we looked for a machine with good temperature and pressure control.\nDoes the machine have digital, adjustable PID for selecting water temperature? What about a shot timer to check if the espresso is coming out at the right rate? Is there a built-in hot water dispenser? Can you brew in a mug as easily as you can an espresso cup? All of these earned bonus points if a machine had them.\nBuilt-in grinders seem like a wonderful convenience. You don’t need to buy two coffee appliances. You don’t need to keep two coffee appliances on the countertop. But we actually don’t think they’re particularly convenient and more importantly, they don’t work as well as good standalone burr grinders. First, on the convenience point. If you add up the price of the Solis Barista Perfetta Plus and our top rated coffee grinder from Fellow, the cost is less than $550. Even if you pay a bit more for the Bambino Plus, the total cost is around $700. A typical semi-auto machine with a built-in grinder, like the Delonghi La Specialista Arte, costs close to $700 and they can go up from there. So in effect you are buying two coffee appliances. The combined width of the Solis or the Bambino Plus and a grinder is around 12\"". The width of a machine with a built-in grinder is typically between 11\"" and 14\"", so in effect you are keeping two coffee appliances on the countertop.\nBut the bigger issue is with the functionality of the built-in grinders. They aren’t bad, but they are often underpowered compared to standalone grinders. That means that they may not handle light roast coffee beans, which are harder to grind, as well. In our testing of the Breville Barista Express Impress, one particular light roast caused several jams. An additional problem is that, because the grinder is attached to the machine, it is harder to clear or repair because you have to work around the awkward bulk of the brewing side.\nYou will see some claims that built-in grinders are lacking because they have fewer settings than many grinders that fall in the same price range. It’s true they have fewer settings, but they generally have enough espresso specific settings, so we don’t see this as huge shortcoming.\nOverall, while there are good machines with built-in grinders and we mention them below, we don’t recommend them because we think a built-in grinder is limiting. However, if you only use beans labeled something like “espresso roast” you likely won’t have any issues with yours.\nOften, prosumer machines are scaled-down versions of the most sought-after commercial machines. Rancilio does a nice job of scaling down. The countertop presence of the Pro X screams no-nonsense professionalism. It won’t wow anyone with a flashy design, but it is compact, streamlined, and extremely powerful for its size and price point. It has a dual boiler, which means the coffee maker and the steam wand are each hooked up to their own heat source, so you won’t have to wait for the machine to come to the right temperature for steaming milk after pulling a shot. (The steam boiler is held at a higher temperature than the espresso boiler.) The steam wand performed well, although we preferred the one on the Mara X.\nRancilio also made a nice upgrade from earlier versions of this machine by adding a pressure gauge, so it was easy to tell we were pulling shots with the right pressure. We also liked the alarm clock feature. Because it does take a good 15 minutes for the machine to heat up, you can set it to turn on and be ready for you in the morning so you don’t have to wait. It also does come with a hot water dispenser.\nAs we've said, with machines at this level it’s about design and a lot comes down to personal preferences when choosing one. We recommend the Rancilio Silvia Pro X without reservation. We just preferred the coffee from the Lelit.\n\nRancilio Silvia Pro X Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nSeattle Coffee Gear\nAmazon\nWe like the Diletta Mio, and if you’re looking for a prosumer machine, but hoping to keep the cost down, it’s a great choice. The coffee is delicious, but that’s table stakes for an espresso maker. It has a digital PID to control, to a degree, the temperature of the water, a solid steam wand that is connected to its own heating circuit for near simultaneous brewing and steaming. It also heats up more quickly than other high-end machines thanks to a thermoblock; it was ready in well under 10 minutes. Another smart design feature is the water reservoir, which slides out from the side rather than from the top, so if you’re keeping it under a cabinet, it’s easy to refill. After 6 months of use we did start to have occasional issues with the temperature dropping after pulling a shot and found we had to be diligent about flushing the machine with Urnex powder to keep it humming. We also missed having a hot water dispenser and wished it had higher cup clearance.\n\nDiletta Mio Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nSeattle Coffee Gear\nThis one was right up there with our top Lelit pick and we recommend it without hesitation. While tasters preferred the espresso from the Lelit just slightly, the Bello + has all the features that the Mara X lacks: a digital PID, a shot timer, and programmable pre-infusion. The dual pressure gauges for the boiler and the group head were a nice touch, with green markings to let you know the pressure is where it should be. The Bello + also had a faster heat up time at just under 11 minutes. It is one of the largest machines we tested and doesn’t come the comfortable cup clearance of the Mara X. It does, however, have an incredibly powerful steam wand, maybe even too powerful if that’s possible. Milk foamed up in seconds and we had to be careful not to go overboard with it. This is a consistent machine that anyone with a real interest in making quality espresso drinks will be able to get a hang of and use for some time.\n\nDiletta Bello+ Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nThis prosumer model took quite a bit of getting used to. More than any other machine we have tested so far it demanded real precision both in the grinding and tamping phases of making espresso and it required a long warm-up time. Once you get it, you’re rewarded with excellent coffee, but this is a machine for someone who wants to make coffee brewing a significant hobby, not a quick caffeine jolt in the morning. Like the Rocket Aparamento this is a majestic ode to steampunk and the brewing lever is actually felt like a nicer way to brew than the pushbutton interface of the Diletta. It’s easy to control the temperature with the PID and the steam wand is powerful and effective. Ultimately this machine just didn’t feel user-friendly enough to take a top spot though.\n\nProfitec Pro 500 Espresso Machine\nWhole Latte Love\nWhen compared to the other high price point prosumer models, we thought the Rocket Appartamento wasn’t as good for a few key reasons. First, it only has a single boiler, so you have to wait (not that long, but still) between pulling shots and steaming milk. Second, while the machine includes a pressure gauge, it appears to only go up to three bars of pressure. It includes a high-quality portafilter, but we didn’t like its tamper; it didn’t reach all the way to the sides of the portafilter, so it left some straggly bits of grounds around the sides. It doesn’t include a timer or external temperature control, so to dial in all of the components of your espresso, you have to rely on external devices.\n\nRocket Espresso Appartamento Espresso Machine\nSeattle Coffee Gear\nLelit’s mid-level machine produced espresso that we thought was almost as good as what we got from the Mara X, it also came with features the Mara X didn’t like a digital PID and a shot timer. However we had a hard time getting much texture into milk from the steam wand. This is also a single boiler machine, so there is a delay of close to a minute when switching between brewing espresso and steaming milk. Looking at machines in this general price range we’d go for the Diletta Mio.\n\nLelit Victoria Espresso Machine\nSeattle Coffee Gear\nWe were incredibly impressed with this machine during the first couple months we used it. It took everything that was good about about Breville models like the Barista Express and the Barista Pro and added a smart grinding and tamping system that made it easy to consistently dose and tamp your shots properly. But it also showed the limitations of the built-in grinder. Even though the grinder is an improvement over earlier models, it has 25 settings to adjust grind size instead of 18 for example, It jammed with very light roast beans. We actually had to take a vacuum to it to completely clear it out. Again, this was not an issue with medium and dark roast beans.\nThe rest of the experience was terrific. The shots were flavorful, the steam wand created a smooth blanket of foam with both dairy and nondairy milks, and the hot water dispenser was convenient to use. If you stay away from light roasts you will be more than happy with this machine.\n\nBreville Barista Express Impress\nBreville\nWilliams Sonoma\nAmazon\nWe'd barely call the Barista Touch Impress a semi-automatic machine. It slides as close to the line of a fully automatic machine as you can get while still offering the feeling of making your own espresso drink. But, Breville does a nice job with its automation and the coffee from Touch Impress is, well, impressive. It can brew eight different specialty coffee drinks, including cappuccinos, flat whites, long blacks, and lattes. It also has the automatic milk frothing we like so much on the Bambino Plus, but with even more customization. There are different settings for different types of milk (dairy, oat, almond, etc.) and you can set different froth levels. The issues we had with the grinder in the original Barista Express Impress have been improved upon here with the addition of Baratza burrs, but we still generally prefer stand alone grinders to built-in ones as we explained up above. Ultimately though the thing that keeps the Touch Impress from a top spot is its neither here nor there quality. True super automatic machines like the Bosch are easier to use and offer more drink options, and true semi-automatic machines make it easier to tweak your espresso shot, even if they take more trial and error.\n\nBreville Barista Touch Impress Espresso Machine\nWilliams Sonoma\nThe Breville Barista Express is a very good machine but it lost out to the Solis, not only because of our general caution around built-in grinders, but because the steam wand wasn't quite as powerful as the Barista Perfetta’s. Also, though this can be corrected with an after market tamper, the tamper that comes with Breville machines is much lighter weight (not great for a tamper) than what comes with the Solis. Ultimately we think you can get a better package that takes up basically the same amount of space and costs almost the same amount of money getting a Solis, along with a good stand-alone grinder like this KitchenAid.\n\nBreville Barista Express\nAmazon\nNinja’s entry into the semi-automatic espresso field has all the hallmarks the brand has become known for. It is affordable and it has a lot of functions. The espresso/drip coffee maker/cold brew coffee maker has a “jack of all trades, master of none” thing going on. It attempts some of the same smart espresso brewing of newer Breville machines, determining whether you ground the coffee fine enough and recommending changes when shots come out over or under-extracted. The built-in grinder performs adequately and its digital interface is easy to use and gives clear instructions on how to brew. The espresso you get for $499 (at the time of writing) is more nuanced and flavorful than what we typically expect in that price range. The other brewing functions—drip and cold brew—were…fine. The drip coffee came out a little on the hot side, which masked some of the flavors we’d like to see. The cold brew takes less than five minutes, and did deliver coffee that was smoother than what we got using the hot functions, but wasn’t the rich, chocolatey flavor we get with dedicated cold brewers used overnight. Both are nice additions though, if someone in the house wants a larger coffee. The big issue that is keeping the Ninja from making the list as a top budget pick is its milk frothing. It uses a combination of stirring and steaming the milk that resulted in a lot of large bubbles in dairy milk and a real lack of body in alt milks. One other thing to know about the Luxe Café is that it has a very unusual portafilter. It’s extra long to accommodate enough coffee for the drip and cold brew functions.\n\nNinja Luxe Café Premier\nAmazon\nThe Philips Barista Brew, released in 2024, continues the trend of sticking meh burr grinders on to what would otherwise be a more-than-serviceable mid-price espresso maker. There are a lot of things to like about the Barista Brew: the heavy 58mm portafilter, the built-in water spout for americanos, and the quality of the steam wand. But try as we might we couldn’t produce enough pressure to pull a good espresso shot using the attached grinder and tamper, even on the finest grind setting. We know the tamper and grinder were the culprits because when we used a Fellow Ode grinder and a Normcore tamper, the Philips brewed a delicious shot with a lovely layer of crema on top. If they release a version of this machine without a built-in grinder we’d recommend it as a good value pick. But as it is, you’re paying extra for a feature that takes up space and just doesn’t execute.\n\nPhilips Barista Brew Semi Automatic Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nWilliams Sonoma\nUnfortunately we can't recommend Solis' Barista Perfetta Plus any more because it seems to have become unavailable. We love the value this machine offers, producing espresso on par with all the Breville machines we tested in a smaller, less expensive package. The shots were nicely extracted with a striped layer of crema on top. Its steam wand was incredibly powerful for such an affordable machine and made terrific flat whites. The hot water dispenser turned out easy americanos. It has an adaptive PID controller, which is practically unheard of for something under $400, and, at barely seven inches wide, it fits more comfortably on the countertop than any machine except the Bambino Plus. If it becomes widely available again, we'll make sure to let you know.\n\nSolis Barista Perfetta Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nSeattle Coffee Gear\nThe Breville Infuser is basically the Barista Express without a built-in grinder. It brews just like the Express and the Express Impress; it has a pressure gauge and a hot water dispenser separate from the steam wand for making Americanos (or tea if that’s your jam). But like Barista Express its steam wand is less powerful than the Solis’s and didn’t produce quite as high a quality foam. Also it has a much larger footprint than the Solis. If we can get the same coffee in a smaller package, we’ll take it.\n\nBreville Infuser Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nWilliams Sonoma\nOperationally this Delonghi has the same features as a Breville Barista Express but it comes with a number of nice design touches that make it more user friendly. First, a screw-on dosing funnel attaches to the portafilter and fits comfortably into the built-in grinder, which makes it very clean to use (not many stray coffee grounds). It also has a small step that you can place on the drip tray if you’re brewing into a shot glass instead of a mug, which again, makes it cleaner to use (no coffee splashes). The coffee was very tasty and the steam wand performed well, though not quite as well as the Solis or the Breville machines. The timed dosing took a little trial and error to figure out—ultimately we had success with it set around 18. The other thing to be aware of is that Delonghi’s portafilters are a slightly different size than other similar machines; they are just a touch deeper and narrower, which means a standard 54mm tamper won’t work and you will need to use the (quite substantial) one that comes with the machine.\n\nDe’Longhi La Specialista Arte\nAmazon\nWith its black and stainless-steel body, the Gaggia Classic Pro has that Italian café look about it, but it’s not just beautiful on the outside. It’s a nice machine and was the only one we tested in this price range that came with a commercial-size 58-mm portafilter. The problem is that the cheap plastic tamper the machine came with is actually too small for the portafilter. The espresso came out just slightly under-extracted, although it’s hard to know whether that’s because it was challenging to tamp correctly or because of something in the machine itself. Also, unlike everything else we tested in this price range, it has manual controls meaning you have to start and stop every shot with a switch. That’s not a deal-breaker (a lot of great prosumer machines have the same set up), but it is one more step in the process.\n\nGaggia Classic Pro Espresso Machine\nAmazon\n\nDelonghi Eletta Explore\nWilliams Sonoma\nCrate & Barrel\nWe really struggled to get the espresso grind dialed in on the Eletta Explore. The built-in burr grinder has 13 settings, and you’re going to want it set coarser than you’d probably expect—we ended up liking it set at around eight. But once we got it we were able to take advantage of the more than 40 drinks available via the De'Longhi's touchscreen. The drinks were smooth, creamy, and quite different from one another, which, as we noted about the Bosch, is a characteristic sometimes absent from automatic coffee machines. Another nice feature of the Eletta Explore is its ability to produce cold foam for drinks like iced flat whites.\nFinally, for a fairly complicated machine, it offers real ease of use. The water tank is big enough that it doesn’t require refilling for days. It tells you step by step what to do if you aren’t sure—what setting the milk frother should be on, how much ice to add, what to do in order to rinse or clean the machine—and is very clear about how to adjust the settings to make drinks stronger or larger. We’re pretty tech savvy, but would feel totally comfortable giving this to a person who struggles to log in to their email.\nUltimately we think this is a quality automatic machine. It got displaced by the Bosch because of the 800 Series' espresso, which tasted fuller and more interesting, and because the Bosch offered a bit more variety in its milk texture, upping the versatilyt of the machine.\nThe Cuisinart Espresso Machine performed surprisingly well for a semi-automatic machine that costs under $200. It produced a shot with good crema, although it only had pressurized filter baskets, so it was kind of cheating to get it. Like the Gaggia, the Cuisinart has manual controls (it has a dial instead of a switch) to start and stop each brew. The steam wand was quite powerful, but hard to control, leading to more foam than we’d like. But all in all, this is much more than we’d expect from a machine in this price range.\n\nCuisinart Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nJC Penny\nThe acidic coffee (sans crema) from the DeLonghi 15 Bar Espresso and Cappuccino Machine is what it tastes like if you buy a semi-automatic machine for under $100. The steam wand was hard to move out of the way during brewing and produced very firm, almost merengue-like foam. If you’re focused on this price point, get the Nanopresso.\n\nDelonghi 15 Bar Espresso and Cappuccino Machine\nAmazon\nWilliams Sonoma\nThe DeLonghi Dedica Deluxe was probably the most disappointing machine we tried, not because it performed the worst, but because of the huge mismatch between its quality and its $300-plus price tag. From the body to the portafilter, it feels pretty flimsy, and the default brew setting filled the espresso cup so high it was impossible to move without spilling. The coffee was surprisingly flavorless; the espresso reminded us of a so-so pod machine. If you are considering the DeLonghi Dedica, we think you might actually be happier with the Nespresso machine passionately argued for by senior staff writer Emily Farris.\n\nDelonghi Dedica Deluxe\nAmazon\nThe Hamilton Beach Espresso and Cappuccino Maker: Yikes. Hamilton Beach makes a lot of budget-friendly appliances we like (its electric kettle for example, is excellent). This is not one of them. The coffee was watery and yet there was a mysterious crema on top so thick it was almost a mousse. It was incredibly hard to remove the filter basket from the portafilter to clean, because no matter how hard we knocked on the knock box, we couldn’t dislodge the coffee, which had not formed into a puck. The steam wand: Oy. It heated the milk so unevenly, we couldn’t get it heated all the way through without badly scalding part of it.\n\nHamilton Beach Espresso and Cappuccino Maker\nJoann Fabrics\nOf all the fully automatic machines, the Jura made the best espresso, full stop. We drank it side-by-side with the Breville Barista Express Impress, and the Jura's flavors were a little muted in comparison, but they were all there. We know plenty of people who actually prefer a slightly toned down espresso shot. It also got high marks for its many milk drinks (as long as they were made with real cow’s milk; as we noted above we had issues with oat milk). The texture of the milk in our flat whites and cappuccinos was thicker and smoother than what we got from any semi-automatic machine.\nThe E8 was also fairly quiet. Super automatic machines can make a lot of noise (they’re working hard!), but the decibel level of the grinding and brewing in the Jura was on the low side. We think the Jura E8 is a great machine and recommend it, especially if you aren’t an iced coffee person. Ultimately we chose the Delonghi Eletta Explore instead because it could just do a bit more and it had a lower price tag. We should note that there are Juras that can do everything the Delonghi can and more. They just come with price tags close to $4,000—and that was higher than we were ready to consider for this review.\n\nJura E8\nJura\nWilliams Sonoma\nMiele’s machine promised it would be the quietest super automatic machine we’d test and on that it delivered. The decibel level isn’t as if you’re pouring water into a Chemex, but the grinder is quite hushed compared to the Delonghi machines. The quality of the drinks from the Miele were also a big plus, with the tasting notes mentioned on the bean bag actually appearing, which is a challenge for any fully automated machine. The coffee though tasted a bit better than the espresso from the Miele though, the latter being a little flatter in flavor. If the Miele was as versatile as the Delonghi Eletta Explore or the Jura it would probably be the top pick here, but it is limited to seven coffee drinks (espresso, ristretto, long coffee, americano, cappuccino, latte macchiato, cafe latte). We think that’s enough for the majority of people, but the plus-up in terms of capabilities in the Delonghi gives an edge.\n\nMiele CM 5310 Silence Automatic Coffee Maker & Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nPhilips super automatic machine was fine but didn’t wow us. Its interface is similar to the Delonghi Mangnifica above, which is to say, intuitive and easy to use. It offers five different drinks (espresso, coffee, americano, cappuccino, and latte) and the coffee you get in each ranks in the middle of what we tried. The real issue with the Lattego is with its milk, which had very little body. Even the milk cappuccino, which should be quite firm, was closer to steamed milk than it was to foam.\n\nPhilips 200 Series LatteGo Espresso Machine\nAmazon\nThe Magnifica is sort of a slimmed down version of the Eletta Explore both physically (it has a smaller footprint) and in terms of what it can do (it only makes seven different drinks). It made very nice espresso, but the milk didn’t come out quite as smooth as it did on the Eletta Explore. We liked that it was smaller and the fact that it’s $900 less than our top pick is no small thing, but given the limitations in terms of what it puts out, we actually think you’d be better off with one of the Breville semi-automatic machines. If you do want something fully automatic, you get a lot more machine by leveling up to the Eletta (or the Jura for that matter).\n\nDelonghi Magnifica EVO with Milk Frother\nAmazon\nBest Buy\nThe Concierge, which does come with a milk frother, produced fine single, double, or lungo coffees within a few minutes of powering up, but it felt more limited than the Jura E8, the Philips or either Delonghi. The machine was fine, but the competition has really leveled up what an all-in-one super automatic espresso machine can be.\n\nEspressione Concierge\nSur La Table\nAmazon\nThe coffee from the Gaggia was on the same level as the Espressione, but again, the machine is just very limited in what it can do when compared to the more robust Delonghi Eletta Explore and the Jura E8.\n\nGaggia Anime Prestige\nAmazon\nWe’ll admit that it isn’t exactly fair to compare the Flair Pro 2 to most of the other machines in this test because it is a fully manual lever machine. After some messy rounds of trial and error we were able to pull truly delicious shots of espresso with this, but in the meantime we made a bit of a mess with coffee splattered around the kitchen. The trick, should you go this route, is to allow for a short period of pre-infusion by not pressing the lever too hard (the included pressure gauge helps with this). The Flair does offer excellent portability, though, so if you’re looking to take good espresso (better, really, than the Wacaco—the other manual espresso maker we tested) on the road and don’t mind the learning curve associated with this machine, this is a smart choice.\n\nFlair Espresso Maker PRO 2\nAmazon\nLike the Flair Pro 2, the 9Barista is a manual espresso maker that makes truly delicious espresso. Unlike the Flair Pro 2, the 9Barista was incredibly easy to operate. It looks a bit like a Mokapot redesigned by someone from the MoMa store and it makes much better coffee. If you want to go the manual route, this was our favorite machine. it will look beautiful sitting on your stovetop, which it may have to do because it is quite heavy. Our only quibble is that we had a hard time knocking the ground coffee out of the filter basket. Half the time we had to dig it out with a metal chopstick.\n\n9Barista Espresso Machine\n9Barista\nLast updated 8/20/2024\nLet's be real: A good espresso machine is an investment.

Choosing a high-quality mattress is essential for both comfort and personal style (lofty mattresses can add an element of luxury to your room, for example), and it’s one of the biggest investments for your bedroom and sleep. There are numerous factors to consider before buying, including firmness, temperature, pressure relief, and more.\nIf you’re shopping around for a new mattress or want to upgrade from an old mattress, we’ve picked 11 of the very best mattresses as tested by our sleep experts to determine which beds ultimately rank supreme.\nHelix offers a large collection of mattresses with options for just about every comfort preference, budget, and sleep position. Each of the mattress models has a different firmness level as well as the option to go a little fancier with the Luxe or Elite model with added comfort features. A mattress quiz helps you tailor your choice based on your sleep position, temperature, body type, and factors like whether you share your bed. All Helix mattresses also come with enhanced lumbar support to help prevent back pain.\nOur personal Helix favorite? The Helix Midnight Luxe. This Architectural Digest 2024 Sleep Awards winner is a versatile, affordable luxury mattress with a medium-firm feel. The built-in pillow top maintains the sleek angles of your bed instead of giving it a muffin-top look. Read on for more about the Helix Midnight Luxe and our other top picks.\nHere is the complete list of the mattresses we cover in this article.

Check retailers for additional price and size information.\n\nHelix\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Our best mattress overall, the Helix Midnight Luxe has a versatile hybrid design that combines support for back sleepers with pressure relief for side sleepers. The mattress is built with reinforced steel coils layers and multiple layers of foam, thus a hybrid design. A plush pillow top elevates the loft of the mattress for a luxury look while giving side sleepers extra cushion. If you sleep on your stomach, Helix offers firmer mattress models that can help keep your neck from arching out of alignment. We recommend the Dawn or Dusk mattress models for stomach sleepers instead.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Our expert testers say the Helix Midnight Luxe mattress feels plush at first, but becomes more supportive as you settle into the mattress. This balanced feel is the result of three foam and memory foam layers on top of steel coils. The innerspring base gives the mattress a slight bounce and responsive touch, and our testers didn’t feel “stuck” in the top comfort layers. When two testers laid on the mattress and one changed positions, the other felt movement, but the memory foam effectively dulled any major bouncing.\nContributor Jacqueline Wladis said, “I absolutely need a hybrid mattress. I toss and turn in my sleep, I need to stay cool, and I simply MUST have lumbar support for my back and neck! Memory foam mattresses are very trendy, but I’m picky—I don’t want anything too soft or too firm, too hot or too cold, it has to be just right. The Helix Midnight Luxe is, simply, just right.”\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that the Helix Midnight Luxe strikes a balance between comfort and support. While the pillow top and three layers of foam provide pressure relief to shoulders and hips, the coil base should keep most sleepers lifted and their spines in a natural alignment (a gentle S-curve). While its breathable knit design and coil base layer generate good airflow, we also appreciate that we can add on a cooling mattress upgrade, which is a great option for those who sleep hot. The Midnight Luxe is also offered in a slightly firmer, lower-cost standard version (the Helix Midnight) and an Elite version that adds two extra layers of micro-coils for targeted pressure relief and even more cooling.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: “This question does not apply to Helix. This mattress is perfect,” Jacqueline said. We agree, although we’d like to see an even longer trial period to compete with other bed-in-a-box mattress brands—many of which offer 120- to 365-night test periods compared with Helix’s 100 nights. Trialing a mattress for 4 to 12 months also gives sleepers the chance to see how it feels across multiple seasons.\n\nDreamCloud\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? The DreamCloud Original is an affordable mattress that packs in high-end features (like a cashmere blend cover) for less than $700. As a hybrid mattress, it contains multiple layers of comfort and support that include coils with extra edge support, gel memory foam for pressure relief, and a breathable cover to help you stay cool.\nThe springy coils are helpful for those who change positions while sleeping, and the medium-firm feel can accommodate all sleeping positions. It’s also offered in two upgraded versions—the DreamCloud Premier and DreamCloud Premier Rest, which both have extra comfort foam and cooling inclusions.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Thanks to its medium-firm feel, the DreamCloud generates plenty of lumbar support for back sleepers. Our tester found his hips sinking into the top layer slightly, but his back remained neutrally aligned. The supportive coils also generate a bouncy responsiveness, which can help combination sleepers to easily switch sleeping positions. Our testers said moving around on the DreamCloud surface was easy. One tester did experience some lower back pain while sleeping on DreamCloud Original on his stomach. While he believes stomach sleepers under 130 pounds will likely have enough support, stomach sleepers over 130 pounds may need a firmer mattress just due to gravity pushing the top layers down.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that DreamCloud Original includes luxury features like cashmere material and cooling gel memory foam at a budget-friendly price point. “It has that feel of something that’s expensive, when in fact you’re not paying a crazy price for it,” says digital features editor Nick Mafi. And since it feels more like a traditional innerspring mattress, it can also support different sleeping styles.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: As is often the case with springy mattresses, the DreamCloud Original does just an average job of isolating motion. This won’t be an issue for solo sleepers or deep sleepers, but couples and light sleepers may get better motion absorption on the Premier or Premier Rest versions on the DreamCloud, which have deeper layers of movement-absorbing foam.\n\nNectar\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? As one of our best mattresses for side sleepers, the Nectar Premier comes in memory foam or hybrid form, both of which contain multiple foam layers that promote pressure relief and conform to your body. A common issue with foam-heavy mattresses is body heat retention that can keep it too toasty, but the Nectar Premier adds cooling gel to the top layer of foam. If you’re looking for an extra cool mattress, you can upgrade to the Nectar Premier Copper, which uses tiny copper pieces to redistribute heat across the mattress so it doesn’t pool underneath you. Shoppers on a budget can still get excellent pressure relief on the original Nectar memory foam mattress.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? With six inches of foam layers, it may seem like Nectar Premier would run on the plush side, but the mattress is surprisingly firmer that it appears, according to our product tester. Thanks to mid-level firmness and balanced foam feel, Nectar Premier offers good pressure relief and spinal alignment with a gentle touch of comfort and cooling. The hybrid version with coils at the base instead of foam is, predictably, springier than the foam version, but still isolates motion well.\n“It offers extra support without sacrificing comfort, and getting into bed each night is like falling into a cloud,” says senior SEO manager Katie Henwood. “For any fellow light sleepers who share their bed with a loud partner: You won’t feel a thing when your bed mate is tossing and turning. It's the best memory foam mattress I’ve tried—it cancels out any movement so you can sleep peacefully through the night, regardless of what is going on around you.”\nWhat do we love about this mattress? Nectar Premier is topped with a cooling, breathable fabric that helps dissipate body heat. In addition, the cooling cover promotes airflow to help the top of the mattress stay cool. We also appreciate that the mattress is made with different levels of foam that each serve a unique purpose, such as adding structural support or contouring to your body.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We’d make the foam layers more supportive and less squishy. Why? We didn’t find it supportive enough for sleepers over 230 pounds who could sink in too far, especially when side-sleeping.\n\nSaatva\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Research shows that firmness plays a key role in alleviating back pain during sleep, with medium-firm being the ideal choice for the best sleep quality for most people. Saatva is a luxury innerspring mattress that comes in three firmness options—Plush Soft, Luxury Firm, and Firm. Its Luxury Firm firmness option hovers around medium-firm, making it a great option for people with back pain. All versions of the Saatva mattress come with a “zoned” support layer that’s firmer under the lower back, where too much sagging can cause spinal arching that may amplify back pain. The brand also carries other medium-firm to firm mattress models designed to alleviate back pain, such as the Saatva RX hybrid mattress and Zenhaven latex mattresses.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Saatva Luxury Firm mattress feels firmer than most medium-firm mattresses, but the three-inch pillow top adds a layer of cushioning that our testers said added much needed pressure relief. The zoned support is less noticeable in the Luxury Firm and Firm than in the Plush Soft version, where the center third feels like a completely different firmness level. The Luxury Firm version offers just enough support to prevent your hips from sinking into the mattress, so you’ll feel like you’re sleeping on top of the mattress, as opposed to sunken in it. “My partner and I joke about feeling like we’re floating on a sea of comfort. There’s little to no sag. I think any kind of sleeper—side sleepers, stomach sleepers, and back sleepers alike—would like this supportive pick,” says contributor Bailey Berg.\nOur testers also noted that the mattress feels springy and responsive, which is great for those who change positions (called combination sleepers), but not ideal for couples who need motion isolated from one side of the mattress to the other. Testers were split about motion isolation on the Saatva, though. Our motion transfer test showed noticeable movement across the mattress, but Berg noticed no motion transfer—“which makes sleeping through the night easier for the light sleepers out there,” she says.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that Saatva is made with what they call Lumbar Zone Technology to help keep your spine aligned while sleeping, which is why we’ve chosen it as our best mattress for back pain. Saatva also has a generous one-year trial period and lifetime warranty, so you can sleep on the mattress through all four seasons. Additionally, it offers free delivery and setup in your bedroom—sometimes called white-glove delivery. Berg says, “I didn’t lift a finger other than to point out where I wanted it. Saatva has a complimentary white-glove delivery service, so they get everything ready for you. If we had wanted to get rid of an old mattress those same drivers would have taken it with them (though we didn’t need that service).”\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We’d add another layer of comfort foam. If you’re a fan of ultraplush mattresses, even the Saatva Plush Soft probably won’t cut it for you. Saatva mattresses are firmer than average, so you won’t get a deeply cushioned feel even with its softest firmness option. Fans of conforming memory foam may also want to look elsewhere (like the Saatva Loom & Leaf mattress) as the Saatva Classic has a more traditional bouncy and responsive feel.\n\nWinkBed\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? If you’re a fan of firm mattresses, the WinkBed hybrid mattress is one of the best options. According to WinkBed tester and contributor Mark Burka, “It has the firmest option for those who love a firm bed.” This premium mattress comes in four firmness levels—Softer, Luxury Firm, Firmer, and Plus—the latter of which is designed for individuals over 230 pounds. The Firmer version is best for those who prefer the supportive surface of traditional innerspring mattresses. Despite its firm touch, the WinkBed is built with a Euro pillow top with gel-infused foam for added comfort. The pillow top and foam layers are shorter and less plush on the Firmer model, making it a good match for stomach and back sleeping.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Firmer WinkBed is bouncy and supportive. We also tested the Luxury Firm version, which is noticeably softer, though still keeps testers lifted rather than “hugged” by the pillow top. Our testers said they felt comfortable on their back and stomach on the Firmer version, but pressure relief was lacking on their sides. The mattress also has extra support around the edges, so our testers could sit or lie along the edges without feeling unsteady.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? “The mattress’s hybrid components truly give you the best of both worlds at a more affordable price,” says Burka. “The WinkBed mattress technology provides strong edge support and wicks away heat, ensuring sleepers have a calm, peaceful night. The mattress is a more affordable hybrid option compared to others on the market. Plus, for those who are hesitant about purchasing an online mattress, WinkBed provides a 120-day warranty—that’s a six-month sleep trial period!—which is plenty of time to decide if the money was well spent. In my case, it was!”\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: The springy coil layer and thinner pillow top don’t absorb as much motion as mattresses with thicker foam layers on top. While our testers didn’t feel disrupted by movement from the other side of the bed, they noticed it. Couples or light sleepers may prefer a mattress that isolates motion better such as the Nectar we mentioned above.\n\nNolah\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? A hybrid mattress gives the support of a foam mattress and the bouncy feeling of an innerspring mattress. If you’re looking for this specific combination, Nolah Evolution is your best bet. This extra-thick 15-inch hybrid mattress comes in three firmness options of Plush, Luxury Firm, and Firm. It also offers the Nolah Evolution Comfort+ mattress designed specifically to support individuals who weigh more than 300 pounds.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Nolah Evolution is a durable hybrid mattress with high-end cooling features. Our product tester reviewed the Luxury Firm model to get a feel for its design and support. Overall, its airflow-promoting coils and cool foam layers generated a comfortable sleeping environment, while its zoned targeted support kept our product tester’s spine properly aligned.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? Nolah Evolution’s advanced cooling features, which also include a cooling quilted topper with a breathable gusset, easily dispersed body heat. Our product tester also felt very balanced sleeping on her back with the zoned support, which offers targeted pressure relief to add more pressure to specific areas and less pressure to others.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: After trying Nolah Evolution in several sleeping positions, our product tester noted that the mattress fell short for stomach sleeping. Her hips sunk into the comfort layer, which she believes may cause back pain over time. Therefore, if you’re a stomach sleeper, you may want to opt for the Firm model to guarantee enough hip support.\n\nBear\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Back sleepers will find advanced support in the Bear Elite Hybrid, a hybrid mattress made with a five-zone support coil system that offers pressure relief where needed. Coming in Soft, Medium, and Firm options, back sleepers may want to opt for the Medium firmness level for maximum comfort. Bear Elite Hybrid also comes with numerous cooling features, such as copper-infused memory foam and an optional cooling cover that you can upgrade to for an additional fee.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Bear Elite Hybrid’s Medium mattress has a slightly firmer medium-firm feel, which is ideal for back sleeping. Our product tester took a few naps on this mattress, and said its coils serve two important purposes: spinal support and making it easy to move around the top of the mattress (a bonus if you like to sleep on different sides of your bed).\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that Bear Elite Hybrid takes lumbar support seriously. Each layer of the mattress plays a role—the dynamic transition foam, for example, provides ergonomic support and keeps your body weight evenly distributed on the mattress. Individually-encased coils, on the other hand, offer just the right amount of pressure relief.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: The firmest model of Bear Elite Hybrid may not offer enough support for stomach sleepers, so if you fall into this group, you may want to seek out a mattress that has more support like the Saatva mentioned above. However, back sleepers should find this mattress ideal. Bear Elite Hybrid also lacks motion isolation, so couples should take note of this potential pitfall.\n\nBrooklyn Bedding\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? If you run hot and tend to get sweaty while sleeping, the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe can help you stay comfortable thanks to its multiple cooling layers. Coming in three firmness levels of Soft, Medium, and Firm, this luxury cooling mattress includes a cool-to-the-touch cover, breathable comfort foam, and coils that promote airflow and reduce heat retention.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Every layer of the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe has an element of cooling, and our testers noted that they stayed at a comfortable temperature while lying on the mattress. This is a winning feature if you live in a hotter climate. Its foam layers are also responsive, so when paired with the mattress’s sturdy individually-encased coils, the end result is a supportive bed with varying levels of pressure relief depending on the firmness level.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that from top to bottom, Brooklyn Bedding makes cooling a priority in the Aurora Luxe. Rather than simply adding a cooling cover as some mattresses do, this hybrid mattress takes cooling to the next level with a design focused on optimal airflow in every layer. Brooklyn Bedding also offers an excellent value for the cost. “While this brand is a tad pricey for my budget, I found the product to be high quality, “ says visuals editor Lizzie Soufleris. “So if I was splitting the cost with a partner, I would certainly consider purchasing another mattress from Brooklyn Bedding. I would definitely recommend this to a friend! Sustainable materials plus a range of firmness equals a solid people pleaser.”\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: Motion isolation is one area in which the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe is lacking. Since it errs on the bouncy and responsive side, you’ll feel a lot of movement throughout the bed, which can be an issue for couples who tend to move around in their sleep. There’s a good chance that you’ll feel some tossing and turning throughout the night.\n\nTitan\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Having a mattress that supports your unique needs and doesn’t squish down too much is essential, which is why Titan Plus hybrid mattress is an ideal choice for individuals over 230 pounds. This ultra-firm mattress (which we’ve ranked 9/10 on the firmness scale) contains 900 individually-encased coils made out of 100 percent steel, which enhances durability. It also has high-density foam to prevent sagging, plus a cooling-infused gel top foam layer that dissipates body heat.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Titan Plus feels extremely firm. However, our product tester, who is six-foot-seven-inches, found the mattress to feel very supportive when he slept on his back. His hips didn’t sink into the top layers, and his spine felt properly aligned. Sleeping on his side, however, wasn’t as comfortable, as the firmness created pressure around his shoulders and hips.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? The Titan Plus is designed for people who weigh between 230 and 500 pounds, making it a versatile choice for individuals who need more support. Thanks to its numerous reinforced layers, it also works for both back and stomach sleeping equally. We also appreciate its breathable and cooling features, as well as the opportunity to upgrade to a cooling cover for more enhanced cooling capabilities.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We’d soften up the top layers just a smidge. The TitanPlus will likely feel way too firm for you if you sleep on your side, which could be an issue for couples who bed-share if one partner is a side sleeper or falls outside of Titan Plus’s ideal weight range.\n\nBirch\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? The Birch Natural is an affordable latex hybrid mattress-in-a-box that’s delivered directly to your front door. The materials in this mattress are all natural and organic, including a coil and wool base, a latex cushioning layer, and an organic cotton and wool cover. The mattress has a natural springiness that makes moving around and changing positions easy. The latex and coil combination is also very cooling, which makes this mattress a good choice for hot sleepers.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Birch Natural is significantly firmer than many other mattresses on our list, even though they advertise it as medium-firm on the firmness scale. One of our product testers found it comfortable for back and stomach sleeping, since its firmness helped support his hips, lower back, and neck. While supportive, it felt too firm for side sleeping. You can add a Birch latex mattress topper for a medium-soft feel. The coil foundation gives it noticeable bounce and helps with ease of movement, but the latex layer didn't absorb as much surface movement as a foam mattress would. The Birch performed slightly below average during our water test where we place a glass of water on one side of the mattress and push into the other side—we saw quite a bit of movement in the glass.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? The Birch Natural offers plenty of support for couples or those sharing a bed. Its high-density latex layer helps prevent sagging, and the mattress is designed to support more than 300 pounds of weight on each side. It also sleeps cool, thanks to its breathable coil base and cover that helps wick away moisture, making it excellent for hot sleepers.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We would like to see more contouring around pressure points. On the Birch, you won’t get much deep pressure point cushioning like you would on a traditional memory foam mattress. We'd also like to see improved motion control for those who share a bed.\n\nTempur-Pedic\nTester: Ashley Zlatopolsky, a long-term Tempur-Pedic owner\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Tempur-Pedic is widely hailed as the best memory foam mattress, and for good reason. While Tempur-Pedic can be more expensive than most, it offers different memory foam mattresses at various price points that each come with unique features. The Tempur-Breeze collection, for example, features memory foam mattresses with advanced cooling technology that lowers the mattress temperature by 5 to 10 degrees. Our lab testing using a thermal imaging camera confirmed the cooling properties. Tempur-Pedic mattresses also come with removable and washable top covers, so you don’t have to worry about your mattress getting stained or dirty over time (which is important for a large investment).\nWhat does this mattress feel like? I personally own a Tempur-Pedic LuxeBreeze Soft mattress, which cools by 10 degrees, I can personally vouch for the advanced cooling technology. The mattress remains icy cold, even on hotter days. My Tempur-Pedic LuxeBreeze may be the Soft variation, but I would categorize it as more of a medium-soft (mattresses come in Soft, Medium, or Firm options). Still, I found this firmness level to be perfect for me, as it eliminated hip pain I was experiencing from side sleeping on my old mattress, which was much more plush.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? I tend to run hot while sleeping, so I love that my Tempur-Pedic LuxeBreeze remains cold, even with a waterproof mattress cover (I use a Tempur-Pedic mattress cover that also promotes ventilation). This mattress also has good motion isolation, so I don’t get woken up when my husband gets up early for work. The memory foam does a great job of contouring, and the mattress conforms to my body without me sinking in too deeply, which isn’t always the case with soft mattresses, as they usually feel more plush.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: My main issue with Tempur-Pedic is that it took a long time to break in. While this is the case with most memory foam mattresses, I felt that the Tempur-Pedic took much longer (about three to four months) before it finally contoured properly. The waiting period was tough, as my back and hips hurt while sleeping because the mattress was too firm. Now that it’s broken in, though, I would say the firmness level is perfect, so be patient if you plan on purchasing a Tempur-Pedic mattress because the end result is likely worth it.\nStill haven’t found what you’re looking for? These five additional Clever-approved mattresses have been tried and tested by our team for quality and comfort.\nOne of our mattress testers checking the heat retention of a mattress.\nWe take numerous steps to determine which top mattresses are Clever-approved. In addition to our standard “rest test,” which includes lying or napping on a mattress to see how it feels, we also conduct various assessments to gauge pressure relief, motion isolation, and overall support.\nAfter our hands-on testing is complete, we then consult a network of sleep experts that includes physical therapists, doctors, psychologists, and other medical professionals to back up and verify any medical claims. From there, we present our findings so you can make the best decision about which best-rated mattress suits your personal style and sleep needs.\nCheck out our sleep product testing methodology to learn more about how we test mattresses and other sleep products.\nOur sleep product tester assessing the edge support of the Saatva Classic mattress.\nThere are a few factors you’ll want to consider when determining the best mattress for your specific needs. Here’s how to pick a dreamy mattress for your sleeping style, temperature preference, and more.\nMattresses often come in three levels of firmness: soft, medium, and firm, or sometimes combinations such as medium-soft or medium-firm. Chester Wu, MD, who is double board-certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine, explains why firmness in a mattress matters.\n“Firmness in a mattress is associated with the support it provides,” he says. “A firmer mattress typically offers better support by maintaining proper spinal alignment and preventing the body from sinking too deeply, but your sleeping position matters.”\n“If you’re a side sleeper,” he continues, “you may benefit from a medium-soft mattress to give your hips and shoulders enough support. Back sleepers, meanwhile, might prefer a firmer mattress that’ll keep their spine in alignment.”\nWu adds that heavier individuals may also need a more supportive mattress that doesn’t sink down too far from gravity. “Medium-firm mattresses often work well for people in the average weight range, roughly 130 to 230 pounds,” he says.\nA mattress with pressure relief features can be a great option for people with back or neck pain.\n“Pressure relief from a mattress means that the mattress helps evenly distribute your body weight across the mattress surface to reduce stress on body pressure points like the hips and lower back, which might otherwise cause discomfort and pain,” Wu says. “Look for mattress materials like memory foam and latex, which are known for their contouring properties.”\nWhile you likely won’t find a mattress specifically made for keeping you warm, you will encounter different mattresses on the market with cooling features, which can help hot sleepers sleep more comfortably.\n“Not all mattresses support temperature regulation equally,” Wu says. “If you sleep hot, consider mattresses with cooling properties, like those with gel-infused memory foam or specific latex types.” Keep in mind, however, that cooling mattresses tend to carry a higher price point.\nPeople who sleep alone may not need to worry about motion isolation, but if you share a bed with a partner, a mattress with motion isolation can help you both get better rest.\n“If you share a bed, you may want to consider motion isolation features, which can help minimize mattress movement and related sleep disturbances if you or your bed partner move around a lot at night,” Wu describes.\nMany mattress brands offer trial and return periods known as sleep or at-home trials.\nDuring these trial periods, which can range from one month to one year, you can return your mattress for a full refund if you’re not satisfied with your sleep. While trial periods vary greatly from brand to brand, most mattress brands offer a three-to-four-month sleep trial, but require a minimum of 30 days of mattress use before processing a return.\nIdeally, you’ll want to purchase a mattress from a brand that offers a generous trial and return period. This is because mattresses can take several weeks to several months to fully break in, meaning you won’t get the full mattress experience off the bat. (Your mattress, for example, may feel more firm prior to breaking it in.)\nA longer trial and return period can help you determine how your mattress shapes up over time. However, keep in mind that some mattress brands may charge a restocking fee with a return.\nMattresses have a huge range in price. More budget-friendly buys can cost you a few hundred dollars, while luxury mattresses can easily climb as high as $5,000 or more. Be sure to take your budget into consideration, as well as what features are most important to you, and which features you can live without (such as cooling or motion isolation). You can also shop around for a mattress on Amazon and official brand websites to find the best price and mattress delivery options.\nOne of our sleep product testers taking a nap on the WinkBed.\nBuying a mattress in-store or online each comes with benefits and drawbacks. Purchasing a mattress in-store lets you test the mattress first-hand before buying, which is a major perk considering most mattresses will cost several hundred or even thousands of dollars. When you buy in-store, you’ll have a chance to lay on a mattress and see if it feels comfortable to you. That said, laying on a mattress for 10 minutes isn’t always the most thorough way to test for comfort.\nBuying a mattress in-store may also net you better deals, especially if you buy from a salesperson or bundle your mattress with other sleep items. You might even be able to snag free delivery and hauling away of your old mattress, which isn’t always easy to dispose of on your own.\nBuying online offers the convenience of one-click purchasing. It doesn’t require an IRL visit, and you likely won’t encounter any pressure to purchase a higher-end or more expensive mattress than you initially intended to. That being said, you won’t have a chance to test a mattress before buying it, and while online purchases will still likely include a trial and return period, going through the hassle of returning a bulky item like a mattress may end up being more of a headache. However, you can get a great deal on an online mattress if you shop around major shopping weekends like Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Black Friday/Cyber Monday.\nThere are four main types of mattresses you’ll encounter for sale. Here’s how they differ.\nWhile there’s no one universal best mattress brand for everyone, leading mattress brands in the U.S. include Saatva, Helix, Casper, Tempur-Pedic, Sealy, and Beautyrest. The best mattress brand for you will ultimately depend on your preferred sleeping position, comfort preferences, style, and budget.\nYou’ll often encounter mattress sales throughout the year, but many mattress brands offer their deepest discount in spring around Memorial Day or late fall during Cyber Weekend. Other holidays with mattress sales are July 4th and Labor Day.\nHow much you should spend on a mattress will vary based on your budget, but the average queen-size mattress costs $1,500 to $2,000. If you’re looking to splurge, a luxury queen-size mattress (which will likely net you higher-end features like cooling and motion isolation) will probably cost north of $2,000. However, this investment will likely be worth it for the benefits.\nThe average mattress lasts 10 to 12 years. If you’re nearing or past that window, you may want to consider replacing your mattress, as mattresses can sag or get lumpy over time. General upkeep and cleaning a mattress regularly may also help extend its lifespan.\nHybrid and memory foam mattresses each come with benefits and drawbacks. Memory foam, for instance, is best for pressure relief and contouring to your body (or that “hug-like” feeling). Hybrid mattresses, on the other hand, are better for temperature regulation and offer more buoyancy for those who change positions. The best mattress type for you will depend on your sleep style and preferences.\nSubscriptions\nConnect with AD\n© 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Check retailers for additional price and size information.\n\nHelix\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Our best mattress overall, the Helix Midnight Luxe has a versatile hybrid design that combines support for back sleepers with pressure relief for side sleepers. The mattress is built with reinforced steel coils layers and multiple layers of foam, thus a hybrid design. A plush pillow top elevates the loft of the mattress for a luxury look while giving side sleepers extra cushion. If you sleep on your stomach, Helix offers firmer mattress models that can help keep your neck from arching out of alignment. We recommend the Dawn or Dusk mattress models for stomach sleepers instead.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Our expert testers say the Helix Midnight Luxe mattress feels plush at first, but becomes more supportive as you settle into the mattress. This balanced feel is the result of three foam and memory foam layers on top of steel coils. The innerspring base gives the mattress a slight bounce and responsive touch, and our testers didn’t feel “stuck” in the top comfort layers. When two testers laid on the mattress and one changed positions, the other felt movement, but the memory foam effectively dulled any major bouncing.\nContributor Jacqueline Wladis said, “I absolutely need a hybrid mattress. I toss and turn in my sleep, I need to stay cool, and I simply MUST have lumbar support for my back and neck! Memory foam mattresses are very trendy, but I’m picky—I don’t want anything too soft or too firm, too hot or too cold, it has to be just right. The Helix Midnight Luxe is, simply, just right.”\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that the Helix Midnight Luxe strikes a balance between comfort and support. While the pillow top and three layers of foam provide pressure relief to shoulders and hips, the coil base should keep most sleepers lifted and their spines in a natural alignment (a gentle S-curve). While its breathable knit design and coil base layer generate good airflow, we also appreciate that we can add on a cooling mattress upgrade, which is a great option for those who sleep hot. The Midnight Luxe is also offered in a slightly firmer, lower-cost standard version (the Helix Midnight) and an Elite version that adds two extra layers of micro-coils for targeted pressure relief and even more cooling.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: “This question does not apply to Helix. This mattress is perfect,” Jacqueline said. We agree, although we’d like to see an even longer trial period to compete with other bed-in-a-box mattress brands—many of which offer 120- to 365-night test periods compared with Helix’s 100 nights. Trialing a mattress for 4 to 12 months also gives sleepers the chance to see how it feels across multiple seasons.\n\nDreamCloud\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? The DreamCloud Original is an affordable mattress that packs in high-end features (like a cashmere blend cover) for less than $700. As a hybrid mattress, it contains multiple layers of comfort and support that include coils with extra edge support, gel memory foam for pressure relief, and a breathable cover to help you stay cool.\nThe springy coils are helpful for those who change positions while sleeping, and the medium-firm feel can accommodate all sleeping positions. It’s also offered in two upgraded versions—the DreamCloud Premier and DreamCloud Premier Rest, which both have extra comfort foam and cooling inclusions.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Thanks to its medium-firm feel, the DreamCloud generates plenty of lumbar support for back sleepers. Our tester found his hips sinking into the top layer slightly, but his back remained neutrally aligned. The supportive coils also generate a bouncy responsiveness, which can help combination sleepers to easily switch sleeping positions. Our testers said moving around on the DreamCloud surface was easy. One tester did experience some lower back pain while sleeping on DreamCloud Original on his stomach. While he believes stomach sleepers under 130 pounds will likely have enough support, stomach sleepers over 130 pounds may need a firmer mattress just due to gravity pushing the top layers down.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that DreamCloud Original includes luxury features like cashmere material and cooling gel memory foam at a budget-friendly price point. “It has that feel of something that’s expensive, when in fact you’re not paying a crazy price for it,” says digital features editor Nick Mafi. And since it feels more like a traditional innerspring mattress, it can also support different sleeping styles.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: As is often the case with springy mattresses, the DreamCloud Original does just an average job of isolating motion. This won’t be an issue for solo sleepers or deep sleepers, but couples and light sleepers may get better motion absorption on the Premier or Premier Rest versions on the DreamCloud, which have deeper layers of movement-absorbing foam.\n\nNectar\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? As one of our best mattresses for side sleepers, the Nectar Premier comes in memory foam or hybrid form, both of which contain multiple foam layers that promote pressure relief and conform to your body. A common issue with foam-heavy mattresses is body heat retention that can keep it too toasty, but the Nectar Premier adds cooling gel to the top layer of foam. If you’re looking for an extra cool mattress, you can upgrade to the Nectar Premier Copper, which uses tiny copper pieces to redistribute heat across the mattress so it doesn’t pool underneath you. Shoppers on a budget can still get excellent pressure relief on the original Nectar memory foam mattress.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? With six inches of foam layers, it may seem like Nectar Premier would run on the plush side, but the mattress is surprisingly firmer that it appears, according to our product tester. Thanks to mid-level firmness and balanced foam feel, Nectar Premier offers good pressure relief and spinal alignment with a gentle touch of comfort and cooling. The hybrid version with coils at the base instead of foam is, predictably, springier than the foam version, but still isolates motion well.\n“It offers extra support without sacrificing comfort, and getting into bed each night is like falling into a cloud,” says senior SEO manager Katie Henwood. “For any fellow light sleepers who share their bed with a loud partner: You won’t feel a thing when your bed mate is tossing and turning. It's the best memory foam mattress I’ve tried—it cancels out any movement so you can sleep peacefully through the night, regardless of what is going on around you.”\nWhat do we love about this mattress? Nectar Premier is topped with a cooling, breathable fabric that helps dissipate body heat. In addition, the cooling cover promotes airflow to help the top of the mattress stay cool. We also appreciate that the mattress is made with different levels of foam that each serve a unique purpose, such as adding structural support or contouring to your body.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We’d make the foam layers more supportive and less squishy. Why? We didn’t find it supportive enough for sleepers over 230 pounds who could sink in too far, especially when side-sleeping.\n\nSaatva\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Research shows that firmness plays a key role in alleviating back pain during sleep, with medium-firm being the ideal choice for the best sleep quality for most people. Saatva is a luxury innerspring mattress that comes in three firmness options—Plush Soft, Luxury Firm, and Firm. Its Luxury Firm firmness option hovers around medium-firm, making it a great option for people with back pain. All versions of the Saatva mattress come with a “zoned” support layer that’s firmer under the lower back, where too much sagging can cause spinal arching that may amplify back pain. The brand also carries other medium-firm to firm mattress models designed to alleviate back pain, such as the Saatva RX hybrid mattress and Zenhaven latex mattresses.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Saatva Luxury Firm mattress feels firmer than most medium-firm mattresses, but the three-inch pillow top adds a layer of cushioning that our testers said added much needed pressure relief. The zoned support is less noticeable in the Luxury Firm and Firm than in the Plush Soft version, where the center third feels like a completely different firmness level. The Luxury Firm version offers just enough support to prevent your hips from sinking into the mattress, so you’ll feel like you’re sleeping on top of the mattress, as opposed to sunken in it. “My partner and I joke about feeling like we’re floating on a sea of comfort. There’s little to no sag. I think any kind of sleeper—side sleepers, stomach sleepers, and back sleepers alike—would like this supportive pick,” says contributor Bailey Berg.\nOur testers also noted that the mattress feels springy and responsive, which is great for those who change positions (called combination sleepers), but not ideal for couples who need motion isolated from one side of the mattress to the other. Testers were split about motion isolation on the Saatva, though. Our motion transfer test showed noticeable movement across the mattress, but Berg noticed no motion transfer—“which makes sleeping through the night easier for the light sleepers out there,” she says.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that Saatva is made with what they call Lumbar Zone Technology to help keep your spine aligned while sleeping, which is why we’ve chosen it as our best mattress for back pain. Saatva also has a generous one-year trial period and lifetime warranty, so you can sleep on the mattress through all four seasons. Additionally, it offers free delivery and setup in your bedroom—sometimes called white-glove delivery. Berg says, “I didn’t lift a finger other than to point out where I wanted it. Saatva has a complimentary white-glove delivery service, so they get everything ready for you. If we had wanted to get rid of an old mattress those same drivers would have taken it with them (though we didn’t need that service).”\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We’d add another layer of comfort foam. If you’re a fan of ultraplush mattresses, even the Saatva Plush Soft probably won’t cut it for you. Saatva mattresses are firmer than average, so you won’t get a deeply cushioned feel even with its softest firmness option. Fans of conforming memory foam may also want to look elsewhere (like the Saatva Loom & Leaf mattress) as the Saatva Classic has a more traditional bouncy and responsive feel.\n\nWinkBed\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? If you’re a fan of firm mattresses, the WinkBed hybrid mattress is one of the best options. According to WinkBed tester and contributor Mark Burka, “It has the firmest option for those who love a firm bed.” This premium mattress comes in four firmness levels—Softer, Luxury Firm, Firmer, and Plus—the latter of which is designed for individuals over 230 pounds. The Firmer version is best for those who prefer the supportive surface of traditional innerspring mattresses. Despite its firm touch, the WinkBed is built with a Euro pillow top with gel-infused foam for added comfort. The pillow top and foam layers are shorter and less plush on the Firmer model, making it a good match for stomach and back sleeping.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Firmer WinkBed is bouncy and supportive. We also tested the Luxury Firm version, which is noticeably softer, though still keeps testers lifted rather than “hugged” by the pillow top. Our testers said they felt comfortable on their back and stomach on the Firmer version, but pressure relief was lacking on their sides. The mattress also has extra support around the edges, so our testers could sit or lie along the edges without feeling unsteady.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? “The mattress’s hybrid components truly give you the best of both worlds at a more affordable price,” says Burka. “The WinkBed mattress technology provides strong edge support and wicks away heat, ensuring sleepers have a calm, peaceful night. The mattress is a more affordable hybrid option compared to others on the market. Plus, for those who are hesitant about purchasing an online mattress, WinkBed provides a 120-day warranty—that’s a six-month sleep trial period!—which is plenty of time to decide if the money was well spent. In my case, it was!”\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: The springy coil layer and thinner pillow top don’t absorb as much motion as mattresses with thicker foam layers on top. While our testers didn’t feel disrupted by movement from the other side of the bed, they noticed it. Couples or light sleepers may prefer a mattress that isolates motion better such as the Nectar we mentioned above.\n\nNolah\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? A hybrid mattress gives the support of a foam mattress and the bouncy feeling of an innerspring mattress. If you’re looking for this specific combination, Nolah Evolution is your best bet. This extra-thick 15-inch hybrid mattress comes in three firmness options of Plush, Luxury Firm, and Firm. It also offers the Nolah Evolution Comfort+ mattress designed specifically to support individuals who weigh more than 300 pounds.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Nolah Evolution is a durable hybrid mattress with high-end cooling features. Our product tester reviewed the Luxury Firm model to get a feel for its design and support. Overall, its airflow-promoting coils and cool foam layers generated a comfortable sleeping environment, while its zoned targeted support kept our product tester’s spine properly aligned.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? Nolah Evolution’s advanced cooling features, which also include a cooling quilted topper with a breathable gusset, easily dispersed body heat. Our product tester also felt very balanced sleeping on her back with the zoned support, which offers targeted pressure relief to add more pressure to specific areas and less pressure to others.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: After trying Nolah Evolution in several sleeping positions, our product tester noted that the mattress fell short for stomach sleeping. Her hips sunk into the comfort layer, which she believes may cause back pain over time. Therefore, if you’re a stomach sleeper, you may want to opt for the Firm model to guarantee enough hip support.\n\nBear\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Back sleepers will find advanced support in the Bear Elite Hybrid, a hybrid mattress made with a five-zone support coil system that offers pressure relief where needed. Coming in Soft, Medium, and Firm options, back sleepers may want to opt for the Medium firmness level for maximum comfort. Bear Elite Hybrid also comes with numerous cooling features, such as copper-infused memory foam and an optional cooling cover that you can upgrade to for an additional fee.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Bear Elite Hybrid’s Medium mattress has a slightly firmer medium-firm feel, which is ideal for back sleeping. Our product tester took a few naps on this mattress, and said its coils serve two important purposes: spinal support and making it easy to move around the top of the mattress (a bonus if you like to sleep on different sides of your bed).\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that Bear Elite Hybrid takes lumbar support seriously. Each layer of the mattress plays a role—the dynamic transition foam, for example, provides ergonomic support and keeps your body weight evenly distributed on the mattress. Individually-encased coils, on the other hand, offer just the right amount of pressure relief.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: The firmest model of Bear Elite Hybrid may not offer enough support for stomach sleepers, so if you fall into this group, you may want to seek out a mattress that has more support like the Saatva mentioned above. However, back sleepers should find this mattress ideal. Bear Elite Hybrid also lacks motion isolation, so couples should take note of this potential pitfall.\n\nBrooklyn Bedding\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? If you run hot and tend to get sweaty while sleeping, the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe can help you stay comfortable thanks to its multiple cooling layers. Coming in three firmness levels of Soft, Medium, and Firm, this luxury cooling mattress includes a cool-to-the-touch cover, breathable comfort foam, and coils that promote airflow and reduce heat retention.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Every layer of the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe has an element of cooling, and our testers noted that they stayed at a comfortable temperature while lying on the mattress. This is a winning feature if you live in a hotter climate. Its foam layers are also responsive, so when paired with the mattress’s sturdy individually-encased coils, the end result is a supportive bed with varying levels of pressure relief depending on the firmness level.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? We love that from top to bottom, Brooklyn Bedding makes cooling a priority in the Aurora Luxe. Rather than simply adding a cooling cover as some mattresses do, this hybrid mattress takes cooling to the next level with a design focused on optimal airflow in every layer. Brooklyn Bedding also offers an excellent value for the cost. “While this brand is a tad pricey for my budget, I found the product to be high quality, “ says visuals editor Lizzie Soufleris. “So if I was splitting the cost with a partner, I would certainly consider purchasing another mattress from Brooklyn Bedding. I would definitely recommend this to a friend! Sustainable materials plus a range of firmness equals a solid people pleaser.”\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: Motion isolation is one area in which the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe is lacking. Since it errs on the bouncy and responsive side, you’ll feel a lot of movement throughout the bed, which can be an issue for couples who tend to move around in their sleep. There’s a good chance that you’ll feel some tossing and turning throughout the night.\n\nTitan\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Having a mattress that supports your unique needs and doesn’t squish down too much is essential, which is why Titan Plus hybrid mattress is an ideal choice for individuals over 230 pounds. This ultra-firm mattress (which we’ve ranked 9/10 on the firmness scale) contains 900 individually-encased coils made out of 100 percent steel, which enhances durability. It also has high-density foam to prevent sagging, plus a cooling-infused gel top foam layer that dissipates body heat.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? Titan Plus feels extremely firm. However, our product tester, who is six-foot-seven-inches, found the mattress to feel very supportive when he slept on his back. His hips didn’t sink into the top layers, and his spine felt properly aligned. Sleeping on his side, however, wasn’t as comfortable, as the firmness created pressure around his shoulders and hips.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? The Titan Plus is designed for people who weigh between 230 and 500 pounds, making it a versatile choice for individuals who need more support. Thanks to its numerous reinforced layers, it also works for both back and stomach sleeping equally. We also appreciate its breathable and cooling features, as well as the opportunity to upgrade to a cooling cover for more enhanced cooling capabilities.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We’d soften up the top layers just a smidge. The TitanPlus will likely feel way too firm for you if you sleep on your side, which could be an issue for couples who bed-share if one partner is a side sleeper or falls outside of Titan Plus’s ideal weight range.\n\nBirch\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? The Birch Natural is an affordable latex hybrid mattress-in-a-box that’s delivered directly to your front door. The materials in this mattress are all natural and organic, including a coil and wool base, a latex cushioning layer, and an organic cotton and wool cover. The mattress has a natural springiness that makes moving around and changing positions easy. The latex and coil combination is also very cooling, which makes this mattress a good choice for hot sleepers.\nWhat does this mattress feel like? The Birch Natural is significantly firmer than many other mattresses on our list, even though they advertise it as medium-firm on the firmness scale. One of our product testers found it comfortable for back and stomach sleeping, since its firmness helped support his hips, lower back, and neck. While supportive, it felt too firm for side sleeping. You can add a Birch latex mattress topper for a medium-soft feel. The coil foundation gives it noticeable bounce and helps with ease of movement, but the latex layer didn't absorb as much surface movement as a foam mattress would. The Birch performed slightly below average during our water test where we place a glass of water on one side of the mattress and push into the other side—we saw quite a bit of movement in the glass.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? The Birch Natural offers plenty of support for couples or those sharing a bed. Its high-density latex layer helps prevent sagging, and the mattress is designed to support more than 300 pounds of weight on each side. It also sleeps cool, thanks to its breathable coil base and cover that helps wick away moisture, making it excellent for hot sleepers.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: We would like to see more contouring around pressure points. On the Birch, you won’t get much deep pressure point cushioning like you would on a traditional memory foam mattress. We'd also like to see improved motion control for those who share a bed.\n\nTempur-Pedic\nTester: Ashley Zlatopolsky, a long-term Tempur-Pedic owner\nWhy should sleepers choose this mattress? Tempur-Pedic is widely hailed as the best memory foam mattress, and for good reason. While Tempur-Pedic can be more expensive than most, it offers different memory foam mattresses at various price points that each come with unique features. The Tempur-Breeze collection, for example, features memory foam mattresses with advanced cooling technology that lowers the mattress temperature by 5 to 10 degrees. Our lab testing using a thermal imaging camera confirmed the cooling properties. Tempur-Pedic mattresses also come with removable and washable top covers, so you don’t have to worry about your mattress getting stained or dirty over time (which is important for a large investment).\nWhat does this mattress feel like? I personally own a Tempur-Pedic LuxeBreeze Soft mattress, which cools by 10 degrees, I can personally vouch for the advanced cooling technology. The mattress remains icy cold, even on hotter days. My Tempur-Pedic LuxeBreeze may be the Soft variation, but I would categorize it as more of a medium-soft (mattresses come in Soft, Medium, or Firm options). Still, I found this firmness level to be perfect for me, as it eliminated hip pain I was experiencing from side sleeping on my old mattress, which was much more plush.\nWhat do we love about this mattress? I tend to run hot while sleeping, so I love that my Tempur-Pedic LuxeBreeze remains cold, even with a waterproof mattress cover (I use a Tempur-Pedic mattress cover that also promotes ventilation). This mattress also has good motion isolation, so I don’t get woken up when my husband gets up early for work. The memory foam does a great job of contouring, and the mattress conforms to my body without me sinking in too deeply, which isn’t always the case with soft mattresses, as they usually feel more plush.\nIf we could change anything about this mattress: My main issue with Tempur-Pedic is that it took a long time to break in. While this is the case with most memory foam mattresses, I felt that the Tempur-Pedic took much longer (about three to four months) before it finally contoured properly. The waiting period was tough, as my back and hips hurt while sleeping because the mattress was too firm. Now that it’s broken in, though, I would say the firmness level is perfect, so be patient if you plan on purchasing a Tempur-Pedic mattress because the end result is likely worth it.\nStill haven’t found what you’re looking for? These five additional Clever-approved mattresses have been tried and tested by our team for quality and comfort.\nOne of our mattress testers checking the heat retention of a mattress.\nWe take numerous steps to determine which top mattresses are Clever-approved. In addition to our standard “rest test,” which includes lying or napping on a mattress to see how it feels, we also conduct various assessments to gauge pressure relief, motion isolation, and overall support.\nAfter our hands-on testing is complete, we then consult a network of sleep experts that includes physical therapists, doctors, psychologists, and other medical professionals to back up and verify any medical claims. From there, we present our findings so you can make the best decision about which best-rated mattress suits your personal style and sleep needs.\nCheck out our sleep product testing methodology to learn more about how we test mattresses and other sleep products.\nOur sleep product tester assessing the edge support of the Saatva Classic mattress.\nThere are a few factors you’ll want to consider when determining the best mattress for your specific needs. Here’s how to pick a dreamy mattress for your sleeping style, temperature preference, and more.\nMattresses often come in three levels of firmness: soft, medium, and firm, or sometimes combinations such as medium-soft or medium-firm. Chester Wu, MD, who is double board-certified in psychiatry and sleep medicine, explains why firmness in a mattress matters.\n“Firmness in a mattress is associated with the support it provides,” he says. “A firmer mattress typically offers better support by maintaining proper spinal alignment and preventing the body from sinking too deeply, but your sleeping position matters.”\n“If you’re a side sleeper,” he continues, “you may benefit from a medium-soft mattress to give your hips and shoulders enough support. Back sleepers, meanwhile, might prefer a firmer mattress that’ll keep their spine in alignment.”\nWu adds that heavier individuals may also need a more supportive mattress that doesn’t sink down too far from gravity. “Medium-firm mattresses often work well for people in the average weight range, roughly 130 to 230 pounds,” he says.\nA mattress with pressure relief features can be a great option for people with back or neck pain.\n“Pressure relief from a mattress means that the mattress helps evenly distribute your body weight across the mattress surface to reduce stress on body pressure points like the hips and lower back, which might otherwise cause discomfort and pain,” Wu says. “Look for mattress materials like memory foam and latex, which are known for their contouring properties.”\nWhile you likely won’t find a mattress specifically made for keeping you warm, you will encounter different mattresses on the market with cooling features, which can help hot sleepers sleep more comfortably.\n“Not all mattresses support temperature regulation equally,” Wu says. “If you sleep hot, consider mattresses with cooling properties, like those with gel-infused memory foam or specific latex types.” Keep in mind, however, that cooling mattresses tend to carry a higher price point.\nPeople who sleep alone may not need to worry about motion isolation, but if you share a bed with a partner, a mattress with motion isolation can help you both get better rest.\n“If you share a bed, you may want to consider motion isolation features, which can help minimize mattress movement and related sleep disturbances if you or your bed partner move around a lot at night,” Wu describes.\nMany mattress brands offer trial and return periods known as sleep or at-home trials.\nDuring these trial periods, which can range from one month to one year, you can return your mattress for a full refund if you’re not satisfied with your sleep. While trial periods vary greatly from brand to brand, most mattress brands offer a three-to-four-month sleep trial, but require a minimum of 30 days of mattress use before processing a return.\nIdeally, you’ll want to purchase a mattress from a brand that offers a generous trial and return period. This is because mattresses can take several weeks to several months to fully break in, meaning you won’t get the full mattress experience off the bat. (Your mattress, for example, may feel more firm prior to breaking it in.)\nA longer trial and return period can help you determine how your mattress shapes up over time. However, keep in mind that some mattress brands may charge a restocking fee with a return.\nMattresses have a huge range in price. More budget-friendly buys can cost you a few hundred dollars, while luxury mattresses can easily climb as high as $5,000 or more. Be sure to take your budget into consideration, as well as what features are most important to you, and which features you can live without (such as cooling or motion isolation). You can also shop around for a mattress on Amazon and official brand websites to find the best price and mattress delivery options.\nOne of our sleep product testers taking a nap on the WinkBed.\nBuying a mattress in-store or online each comes with benefits and drawbacks. Purchasing a mattress in-store lets you test the mattress first-hand before buying, which is a major perk considering most mattresses will cost several hundred or even thousands of dollars. When you buy in-store, you’ll have a chance to lay on a mattress and see if it feels comfortable to you. That said, laying on a mattress for 10 minutes isn’t always the most thorough way to test for comfort.\nBuying a mattress in-store may also net you better deals, especially if you buy from a salesperson or bundle your mattress with other sleep items. You might even be able to snag free delivery and hauling away of your old mattress, which isn’t always easy to dispose of on your own.\nBuying online offers the convenience of one-click purchasing. It doesn’t require an IRL visit, and you likely won’t encounter any pressure to purchase a higher-end or more expensive mattress than you initially intended to. That being said, you won’t have a chance to test a mattress before buying it, and while online purchases will still likely include a trial and return period, going through the hassle of returning a bulky item like a mattress may end up being more of a headache. However, you can get a great deal on an online mattress if you shop around major shopping weekends like Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Black Friday/Cyber Monday.\nThere are four main types of mattresses you’ll encounter for sale. Here’s how they differ.\nWhile there’s no one universal best mattress brand for everyone, leading mattress brands in the U.S. include Saatva, Helix, Casper, Tempur-Pedic, Sealy, and Beautyrest. The best mattress brand for you will ultimately depend on your preferred sleeping position, comfort preferences, style, and budget.\nYou’ll often encounter mattress sales throughout the year, but many mattress brands offer their deepest discount in spring around Memorial Day or late fall during Cyber Weekend. Other holidays with mattress sales are July 4th and Labor Day.\nHow much you should spend on a mattress will vary based on your budget, but the average queen-size mattress costs $1,500 to $2,000. If you’re looking to splurge, a luxury queen-size mattress (which will likely net you higher-end features like cooling and motion isolation) will probably cost north of $2,000. However, this investment will likely be worth it for the benefits.\nThe average mattress lasts 10 to 12 years. If you’re nearing or past that window, you may want to consider replacing your mattress, as mattresses can sag or get lumpy over time. General upkeep and cleaning a mattress regularly may also help extend its lifespan.\nHybrid and memory foam mattresses each come with benefits and drawbacks. Memory foam, for instance, is best for pressure relief and contouring to your body (or that “hug-like” feeling). Hybrid mattresses, on the other hand, are better for temperature regulation and offer more buoyancy for those who change positions. The best mattress type for you will depend on your sleep style and preferences.\nSubscriptions\nConnect with AD\n© 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Here's how to shop for the right model, plus our top tested picks.\nLooking for a home projector? Start by being clear about what you want it for: home theater (viewing in a dark room), home entertainment (for ambient light), or gaming (also for ambient light, plus added features for gaming). I'm PCMag's resident projector guru, and I discuss all three types below. I've been reviewing projectors since well before there was any difference between business and home models, let alone among home theater, home entertainment, and gaming projectors. I judge image quality using a standard set of film and video clips, plus other content; factor in other issues ranging from brightness to value; and measure input lag—critical for gaming. My current top pick overall is Epson's Pro Cinema LS12000 for home theater. But read on, both to see how each model earns its recommendation for specific needs, and for the shopping advice that will help you make the right buying decision.\n\n*Deals are selected by our commerce team\n\nThe BenQ TK860i is designed for rooms with ambient light. Its list of key features starts with 4K resolution on screen (using a DLP chip equipped with TI's fast-switch pixel shifting) plus a bright image that can stand up to ambient light. It also adds BenQ's new HDR-PRO technology, which ratchets up image quality from the already-highly watchable level of the previous generation model by a lot, delivering noticeably enhanced shadow detail, contrast, and sense of three-dimensionality both for SDR and for HDR10 and HLG HDR input. The projector also supports full HD 3D and comes with an Android TV 11 dongle to add smart TV streaming features. And for gaming, it delivers measured input lags only a little longer than the current state-of-the-art, and easily short enough for all but the most serious gamers. \nAnyone looking for a family room projector to serve as a TV replacement or for watching movies should have the TK860i on their radar, particularly if they also want a short lag that won't slow down their reaction time for first-person shooter or sports games. Those who see rainbow artifacts (red/green/blue flashes that single-chip DLP projectors can show) will want to make sure they can return the projector easily if they turn out to be a problem. But if you don't see the flashes, or don't mind seeing them, and you're looking for a way to enjoy movies, TV, and potentially gaming at a big screen size with lights on, this BenQ is a top pick.\nThe Epson Pro Cinema LS12000's price is about right for a solid down payment on a new car, but it's actually a near-bargain for the image quality it delivers. Epson is known for pixel-shifting LCD projectors whose images are virtually indistinguishable from a true 4K UHD picture while using only half as many pixels on screen—a trick it manages thanks to lens quality and video processing. The LS12000 boosts the pixel count to a full 3,840 by 2,160, while maintaining the emphasis on top-quality lenses and processing. The result is more detail than we've seen from any pixel-shifting 4K DLP projector. \nThe LS12000 also offers top-tier color accuracy, contrast, black level, and shadow detail, plus sophisticated features that include the ability to adjust the lens easily to give you the same image height when switching between movies with different aspect ratios. And because it's built around three LCD chips, it's guaranteed not show rainbow artifacts—the red-/green/blue flashes that single-chip projectors can show.\nSerious videophiles who think in terms of custom-built home theaters with dark walls, ceilings, and seating to minimize reflections back to the screen will be particularly interested in the LS12000. However, the image quality is good enough that less-demanding viewers will notice, too, even in rooms that are less than perfectly outfitted. This makes it a top home theater pick for anyone who can afford it. \nThe BenQ TH685P is a prime example of why specs don't tell you everything you need to know. Despite offering nearly identical specs to the BenQ model it replaces, this 1080p projector delivers an obviously better image with HDR input. That's a big thumbs-up in a gaming and home entertainment projector at this price. It also impressed us with its audio, thanks to an onboard 5-watt chamber speaker that pumped out quite usable sound quality at high enough volume to fill a large family room.\nThis unit is a top choice for users who aren't prone to seeing rainbow artifacts (or don't find them bothersome if they do see them) and who will appreciate a short input lag for gaming. Good HDR handling and downconverting of 4K HDR content sweeten the deal, though ideally you'll limit HDR material to watching in a darkened room. And if adding an external sound system or headphones isn't an option where you play or watch, this model's speaker output is a plus.\nPriced at $299, the Vankyo Performance V700W stands out from other bargain-basement projectors by being the brightest choice in its price class, at a rated 420 ANSI lumens. It's also a little bigger than most budget-priced competition, but it delivers a similar set of features, including a 1080p (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) native resolution and a highly watchable picture that's guaranteed to be free of rainbow artifacts. We tested it using settings for best image quality rather than highest brightness, and it still lit up a 90-inch screen without problems with lights off. In a family room at night with lights on, it delivered a suitably bright image using an 80-inch screen.\nThe V700W also offers more-than-acceptable image quality, including better shadow detail than most projectors in its price range. Earning it even more points is the impressive onboard audio—for an inexpensive projector at least—built around dual 5-watt speakers as well as Dolby Digital Plus. And the input lag—measured at 26 milliseconds for 1080p/60Hz input—is easily short enough for casual gaming. \nAnyone who wants a big image for movies, video, or games but wants to spend as little as possible for it should put the V700W on their must-see list. You can find less-expensive models, but they will likely have noticeably lower brightness. You might also want to consider it if you already have a projector in a home theater or family room and are looking for an easier way to watch a movie in your backyard than to move the one unit and then reinstall it. The V700W costs little enough to serve as a second projector for occasional use, letting you leave your more expensive projector safely in its permanent setup, undisturbed. \nThe BenQ X3100i is both our top pick for a gaming projector, and the current flagship in BenQ's Immersive Gaming Series. It's also a significant upgrade to the model it replaces in both capacities. Designed to stand up to ambient light, thanks to its 3,300-ANSI-lumen LED light source, it also offers state-of-the art short input lag and houses a pair of 5-watt stereo speakers that can fill a large family room with high-quality sound. \nNewly introduced features for the new generation include support for 1440p (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) resolution at 120Hz (a popular choice for gaming) and a vertical lens shift to adjust image height without introducing keystone distortion. The count of predefined gaming modes also jumps to four: racing game, first-person shooter, role-playing, and sports game. Each mode adjusts both the image and audio settings for the type of game it's named for, and all you have to do is pick the right mode.\nThe X3100i focuses on the features gamers want and need. You can also use it for watching movies and video, and it even comes with an Android TV 11 dongle for streaming, but if you're not planning to take advantage of its gaming-specific features, we see no reason to choose it over a different projector in this list. If you're a serious gamer, however, the X3100i was designed with you in mind, and it's probably the projector you want. \nTo Hisense, an ultra short throw (UST) projector is a projector, but bundle it with a matched screen, and it's a \""laser TV\""—the L9H TriChroma Laser TV being Hisense's current premium model. The projector's available with a choice of screens, to give you either a 100- or 120-inch 4K smart TV with Dolby Vision. With either one, a big part of the attraction is that you don't have to search for the right screen to go with the projector. You don't even have to focus to set it up. The L9H comes with a fixed focus for the screen you ordered. Simply filling the screen with an image gives you sharp focus. It's calibrated for the screen, as well. In our tests, the two together delivered rich, saturated color, good contrast, and a good sense of three-dimensionality in both bright and dark scenes. \nIf you're want a UST model for a room with ambient light, like a family room, and don't already own an ambient light rejection (ALR) screen designed for UST projectors, the L9H should be on your short list. Those sensitive to the red/green/blue flashes of rainbow artifacts should check before buying to make sure they can return it, should they find the flashes annoying, even if they've already assembled the screen. But for those who don't see the flashes or don't find them bothersome, the L9H's combination of bundled screen, features, and image quality makes it a compelling pick.\nThe key advantage of ultra short throw (UST) projectors? Giving you a big image from close to the screen, so you don't have to run cables through walls and ceilings. The key advantage of the Epson LS800? It has an even shorter throw than most. It can actually fill a 120-inch wall-mounted screen without having to pull the furniture it's resting on away from the wall. \nBeyond that, the LS800 offers a laser light source with 4,000-ANSI-lumen brightness, a high-quality image with good color accuracy and contrast, a three-LCD design that guarantees it can't show rainbow artifacts, and an unusually short input lag for a 4K UST projector—a boon for gamers. We measured the lag at just a few milliseconds longer than for today's best gaming projectors for the resolution and refresh rate combinations it supports: 20.4 milliseconds (ms) for 4K/60Hz input, 21.4ms for 1080p/60Hz, and 11.7ms for 1080p/120Hz. It even offers a stereo audio system that amounts to a built-in soundbar, with two 5-watt speakers and a 10-watt subwoofer.\nThe LS800's menus don't have the settings you need for a full calibration, and it doesn't support 3D, which will disappoint serious videophiles and anyone who considers 3D a must-have. For everyone else, it's a sterling choice as a TV replacement, thanks to its excellent image quality straight out of the box, its notably short input lag for gaming, and even more notable short throw.\nThe EpiqVision Mini EF12 pairs a 1,000-lumen laser-phosphor light source with three 1080p LCD chips—one for each primary color—for a 1080p native resolution. The 1,000 ANSI lumens were enough to light up an 80-inch screen in our tests with a suitably bright image and nicely saturated color in a family room at night, even with lights on. It also delivered a watchable image in daytime. Even better, the three-chip design guarantees that there won't be any rainbow artifacts. Two other important pluses are integrated Android TV and a 4.7-pound weight, which makes the EF12 easy to move from room to room or to the backyard.\nFor anyone who sees rainbow artifacts easily and considers them annoying, the EF12 is a prime candidate for a 1080p room-to-room portable projector, and even preferable to any current 4K model in the category, none of which is guaranteed to be rainbow-free. In our tests, the EF12 delivered good image quality, and although it didn't deliver as high a maximum brightness as some competitors did, it had a brighter image for the picture modes that you'll actually want to use.\nThe 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) Hisense C1 Laser Mini Projector is too big to qualify as the mini projector its name suggests. However, it delivers everything we expect in a room-to-room portable, and it's the current hands-down winner for overall image quality in that category. Not only is it one of the so-far rare projectors that supports Dolby Vision—along with the expected HDR10, HLG HDR, and SDR—but it scored well for all the content we look at in our viewing tests (all the above but HLG). In comparison, most of the competition lacks Dolby Vision entirely, which offers some advantages over other HDR options, and some have image-quality issues in one or more of the modes they support. \nOther strong points include a color gamut (range of colors) rated at 110% of BT.2020 (aka Rec.2020), the standard for 4K UHD TVs; built-in streaming with most of the apps you'll likely want already installed; and support for either Wi-Fi or Ethernet for connection to your network for streaming.\nThe C1 can deliver top-tier performance for either of the two main uses that room-to-room projectors are meant for: carrying from room to room, or permanent installation in a family room. It's bright enough, at a rated 1,600 ANSI lumens, to stand up to ambient light in either case, and its onboard stereo audio is robust enough, so you can easily do without an external sound system in most cases. Note that it doesn't offer 3D support, and it tends to show more rainbow artifacts (red/green/blue flashes) than some of its competition. But if neither of those is a deal killer for you, the Hisense C1 belongs on your short list.\nMost projector manufacturers divide their projector lines into categories, but the borders between different kinds of projectors are anything but sharp. Common names for models meant for home use include home cinema, home theater, pro cinema, home entertainment, gaming, streaming, and smart (which is usually just another name for streaming). For business use, the common (and mostly interchangeable) names are business, education, and data projectors, which I'll refer to collectively as business projectors.\nYou should take all of these divisions with a grain of salt, however. Home projectors and business models can overlap more than you might expect. For portable models and some entry-level projectors, you'll often see little or no difference between them for how well they handle film and video. Some manufacturers even include certain models on lists for both categories.\nBeyond that, any home projector that can handle film and video well can also handle text and presentations for business use. And because film and video are often needed in business presentations and classrooms, a business projector might handle film and video just as well as a so-called home entertainment model. That's why we discuss performance with film and video in all of our projector reviews.\nThat said, as a general rule, business projectors much above entry-level pricing for their resolution and brightness can't compete on the basis of film and video image quality with similarly priced home theater or home entertainment models. The smart move is to not make assumptions based on the projector category, and to check out the individual projector's features, and comments in reviews, instead.\nAlthough projector categories change from one manufacturer to another and evolve over time, the application categories are consistent, if somewhat overlapping. Here's a brief look at the most common categories and subcategories of applications, and which features are most important for each.\nThe term \""home theater\"" is often used loosely to include home entertainment. It's more accurate, however, to reserve it for projector use in a room with completely controlled lighting. That could be a dedicated home theater or a family room equipped with shutters or curtains that can block all window light when needed.\nProjectors for home theater don't need particularly high brightness. (More about brightness later.) The most important features to look for in specs and reviews include high contrast, good color accuracy, dark black levels, and good shadow detail. The best home theater projectors today offer 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) resolution and support for HDR (more on HDR later also), but for those on a budget, lots of 1080p projectors can still serve nicely. Resolutions lower than 1080p are best reserved for other applications.\n\""Home entertainment\"" in the projector world covers most home use that isn't home theater, including TV-replacement models, gaming projectors, room-to-room portables, and projectors used for backyard movies.\nIn all of these situations, you will usually be viewing in rooms (or backyards) where ambient light is a factor. That means you need a brighter image, and therefore a brighter projector than with home theater for the picture to stand up to the light at any given image size. On the other hand, contrast is less important. Room light tends to wash out black levels, which lowers contrast for any projector and hides differences between projectors that would be obvious in a dark room.\nNote also that many projectors designed for home entertainment boost brightness at the expense of color accuracy. You'll still want to check to make sure color isn't obviously off, or at least not annoyingly off, but spot-on color accuracy isn't as critical for home entertainment uses as it is in a home theater space with controlled lighting.\nIf your home theater is also your family room with blackout curtains in place (and you'll be using the same projector for both applications), the ideal model will have good color accuracy, high contrast, and other features you need for top image quality in a dark room. But it should also offer high-enough brightness to give you a watchable image in daytime or with lights on at night.\nThe increasingly common \""flat-screen TV replacement\"" projector, typically incorporating smart TV features like streaming, is a key subcategory for home entertainment projectors. Any projector with an HDMI port, which includes virtually all current models, can connect to a set-top box to give you a much larger display for your cable TV or other HDMI TV source. And any of these can be turned into a smart TV by plugging in an HDMI streaming stick.\nBeyond that, some manufacturers sell projectors specifically marketed as TVs or smart TVs, and some models take the extra step of including a TV tuner, so you can even watch broadcast TV directly. Among these smart TVs, some simply include a bundled streaming stick you plug into an HDMI port. (The streaming stick may or may not require a separate remote.) Others include fully integrated streaming, most often using some version of Android TV. Be sure before buying that the projector can connect to the internet via your network using the connection you prefer, whether it's Ethernet or Wi-Fi. For maximum convenience, you'll want the projector and streaming features both controlled by the same remote.\nThe biggest impediment to setting up a projector as a TV has always been the need to mount the projector, most often on a ceiling or on a shelf in the back of the room, and then string wires through walls and ceilings to connect to video sources in the front of the room. Ultra short throw (UST) projectors, which have recently bloomed as a category, solve that problem. Most can give you a 100- to 120-inch image with the projector sitting only inches from the screen, in much the same position where you might otherwise place a flat-screen TV. They're also a lot cheaper than 120-inch flat-screen TVs, even after adding in the cost of the screen, and a lot easier to move into place.\nGaming is obviously a form of home entertainment, but not all home entertainment projectors are good choices for gaming—and you shouldn't assume one is just because it includes a Game mode in its menu (an option that even many business projectors offer). On the other hand, some are perfectly good choices for gaming. And some models labeled as gaming projectors, most notably from BenQ and Optoma, are just as useful for other home entertainment applications.\nThe biggest issue for gaming on a projector is input lag, which is the time in milliseconds (ms) that a display adds between receiving a video frame and putting it on the screen. Input lag can be critical in first-person-shooter games, where short lag will help you survive to the next frame, and long lag is equivalent to having pathetically slow reflexes. A lot of projectors have unacceptably long lag measures for gaming. Others are fully competitive with the lag that gamers are used to seeing in gaming monitors and flat-screen TVs.\nAs a rule of thumb, casual gamers will usually be comfortable with lag up to about 50ms (or a little higher), while serious gamers should look for lag no longer than 16.7ms for 4K/60Hz input, which is the shortest we've seen at 4K as of this writing. At 1080p, a few current models offer lag times as short as 4.16ms at 240Hz, with longer lag times at higher refresh rates.\nNote that for any given projector, the input lag can vary with the resolution, the refresh rate, or both. The only lag that's relevant for your purposes is for the resolution and refresh rate that you plan to use.\nAnother key feature for gaming is how well the projector reveals shadow detail. The quicker you can spot what's going on in dark areas, the quicker you'll see an opponent sneaking up on you or spot objects of interest.\nAt a minimum, the Game mode in a projector will usually turn off video-processing features that lengthen input lag. In many cases, that mode will also brighten up darker areas for you. Some of BenQ's newer gaming models effectively redefine what a gaming projector is by adding separate modes for first-person-shooter, role playing, sports, and racing car games, automatically adjusting settings for both video and audio differently for each mode to match the specific needs of each type of game.\nRoom-to-room portability and backyard movies are two essentially identical applications for a projector, the only difference being whether you're using the projector inside or outside. Both involve moving the projector as needed and setting it up for temporary use only. Any projector that's light enough to move easily can serve in either role, which means you can use the same projector for, say, a TV replacement in your family room most of the time, take it to the basement for gaming sessions, and maybe even tote it to the backyard for a movie night.\nMost projectors suitable for this role weigh between 4 and 10 pounds, although a 10-pound projector is better described as \""luggable\"" rather than \""portable.\"" Some include handles to make them easier to carry. Of particular interest are models with a nearly cubical shape, which gives them both a compact form factor and room for much better onboard sound systems than you'll usually find in models using the more common, flatter overall shape. The higher-volume, higher-quality audio means less need to lug an external sound system with you. Most of these projectors lack batteries, so they will need an AC power source nearby for outdoor use.\nFully portable applications require a projector that weighs less than 4 pounds—usually a lot less—and that can work without AC power, which almost always means having a built-in rechargeable battery. You can use these projectors as room-to-room portables or for backyard movies. But as a general rule, they won't give you as bright an image as projectors in the 4-to-10-pound range at any given image size, even at full power when plugged into an AC power outlet. And when using batteries, the brightness for most such models drops significantly.\nFully portable projectors fall into two broad categories. The larger, brighter models in the group weigh between roughly 2 and 4 pounds, making them small enough to carry easily, but big enough that you won't always want to. The smaller models, known as \""pocket\"" or \""pico\"" projectors, weigh as little as a few ounces, can literally fit in a pocket, and are as easy to carry with you as a cell phone. They even make excellent phone accessories, letting you show photos or watch movies from your phone at a much larger image size. None of these portable models is included here, but you can find them in our roundup of best portable projectors.\nCutting across all the different applications are a handful of specs and features you need to keep in mind: the projector's resolution, support for standard versus high dynamic range (SDR versus HDR) input, the light source, the imaging technology, and the brightness level. Here's a quick overview of the questions to ask about each.\nBefore 4K resolution reached the projector world (4K resolution includes both 4,096 by 2,160 pixels and the more common 3,840 by 2,160 pixels), the resolution spec that mattered most was the native resolution of the imaging chips, meaning the actual number of pixels on the chips themselves. The issue was that although lower-resolution chips can show higher-resolution material, down-converting the image will give it a soft-focus look and can introduce artifacts.\nToday's most expensive 4K projectors use native 4K chips. But the more affordable models you're more likely interested in combine 1,920-by-1,080-pixel chips with pixel shifting. They work by breaking 4K images into multiple sets of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels, and then shifting the pixel position slightly for each set to put more pixels on screen for each frame than are in the chips themselves.\nMost such models use four sets of 1,920 by 1,080 to put a full 3,840 by 2,160 matrix on screen. The majority of Epson's pixel-shifting models use two sets, which puts only half as many pixels on screen. But largely thanks to the limits of human visual acuity, the image using Epson's approach is impossible to distinguish from a full 3,840-by-2,160-pixel image, unless you're far closer to the screen than normal seating distances.\nSome people argue that no pixel-shifting scheme qualifies as \""real\"" 4K. However, most will tell you that they can't see any difference between images produced by projectors with native 4K chips and the best pixel-shifting models, including Epson's models that put lower resolution on screen.\nThanks largely to pixel shifting, 4K resolution is affordable enough today to be the preferred choice for home theater, TV replacements, and gaming, while 1080p is the budget choice. Lower resolution costs still less, but even a 720p image will be noticeably soft-focus compared with 1080p at the image sizes you'll likely be using for these applications.\nFor room-to-room portability and backyard movies, consider first whether you're going to be using a large-enough image to be able to see any difference between 1080p and 4K or even between 720p and 1080p. Any of these resolutions can be a good choice for these applications, depending on image size.\nFor fully portable projectors, 4K isn't an option at this writing. But even when it becomes one, it's unlikely that the projectors will be bright enough to give you a big-enough image in most lighting conditions to see a difference between 1080p and 4K, or possibly even between 1080p and 720p, which remains a good choice for the 2-to-4-pound models. For pocket projectors, brightness is even lower, and the resolutions are lower as well, making even 640-by-360-pixel resolution worth considering.\nHDR has a bigger impact than the step up to 4K on improving perceived image quality. And note that the two features don't always go together. In principle, projectors with HDR support are generally better choices than equivalent models without it, but be sure to check how well it works. Our reviews always discuss image quality for both SDR and HDR.\nAlso check which HDR formats are supported. HDR10 is the most common for projectors. Other possibilities are HDR10+, which builds on HDR10 and is in the process of becoming more widespread; HLG, which is also less common than HDR10, but supported by a growing number of video sources; and Dolby Vision, which is rare in projectors, at least partly because of technical issues.\nProjectors can use traditional lamps, LEDs, or lasers, though the two solid-state choices seem bound to eventually replace lamps entirely. For the moment, those that use lamps are still generally cheaper to buy than essentially identical models that use either of the solid-state options, but LEDs and lasers last for the life of the projector, while you'll likely have to replace a lamp at least once. So when comparing prices, be sure to add in the cost of replacements.\nIn addition to their longer life compared with lamps, solid-state sources maintain a higher percentage of their initial brightness over a longer percentage of their life, which means it will take far longer before you notice any loss of brightness. On the other hand, lamp-based projectors are more likely to deliver the dark blacks and top-tier contrast that matter for home theater. That said, some laser projectors are now catching up on that score, so don't just assume a lamp will be better. Check out comments in reviews for any projector you're considering.\nProjectors can use one of three types of imaging chips: LCD, DLP, or LCoS. The key issue for preferring one over another is less about the chip technology than whether the design projects all the projector's primary colors at once, or rotates through them in sequence, one at a time. \nMost projectors that use a single chip, which includes all affordable DLP models, rotate through the primaries, which can create rainbow artifacts in the form of red/green/blue flashes. Projectors that use three chips, which includes almost all LCD and LCoS models, show all three colors at once, which guarantees an image free of rainbow artifacts. Some inexpensive models use a single LCD, but still show all three colors at once. These models use LCDs with three times as many cells as needed for the resolution; cover each individual cell with a red, green, or blue filter; and combine each red/green/blue triad into a single pixel on screen.\nSome single-chip projectors that use sequential color are more prone to producing these artifacts than others, so even if you see them easily, you won't necessarily see them with every one-chip projector. And some people don't find them distracting. Our reviews indicate how often we saw rainbows in our testing, but our standard advice is to buy single-chip projectors from a dealer that allows easy returns without a restocking fee, so you can judge for yourself. \nAlso note that almost all fully portable projectors are built around a single chip regardless of the imaging technology, so if you need full portability and you see these artifacts easily, you may have to resign yourself to seeing an occasional three-color flash.\nSpecs are largely useless for deciding if a projector is bright enough. Even when accurate, they rarely tell you the brightness for the mode and settings that you'll want to use.\nAs a practical matter, unless you can test a projector yourself, the easiest way to know whether it will be bright enough for your needs is by reading reviews. Ours discuss the usable image sizes we found in different lighting conditions when using the settings we chose for best image quality. Pay particular attention to descriptions of HDR brightness as distinct from SDR brightness, and whether the two are both acceptably bright at the same image size.\nAlso note that your screen can affect image brightness, either increasing it (by reflecting more light toward the center area than to the sides) or lowering it (typically by using a gray screen color that also increases effective contrast). In short, when looking at brightness, you need to consider your screen and projector as a single unit, even if you buy them separately.\nOur current top picks in home projectors vary widely in particulars and are aimed at different home applications, but they have one thing in common: high marks in our reviews.

Take an excellent contrast ratio, paired with impressive brightness and accurate color, all with better detail than what's possible with a 1080p native resolution projector, and you've got all the pieces for a fantastic image. This home entertainment projector isn't cheap, but it offers a significant step up in image quality over other projectors on this list (aside from the Sony, which costs a lot more). It comes with HDMI 2.0, which lets you do 4K60p. Extensive lens shift and a motorized zoom are the icing on the cake.\nThe Vimgo P10's price fluctuates between $70 and $270, in the same ballpark as our favorite cheap projector, the AAXA P8. It's a lot larger than the P8. It's the largest cheap projector we've tested, actually, making it far less portable. But it's still \""small\"" compared with full-size and more expensive projectors, however. \nPicture quality is better than that of the P8 in some ways, worse in others. The Vimgo P10 has a great contrast ratio and decent brightness, but the color is remarkably terrible. The center of the image is noticeably sharper and brighter than the rest of the image. It's not great.\nBut the price is. A perfectly watchable image for less than $150. It even has Netflix built in. Impressive. Read our Vimgo P10 review.\nThe Xgimi Halo Plus is a relatively small 1080p projector with a 2.5-hour battery and surprisingly powerful speakers. It has Android TV built in, so streaming is far easier than with many other portables. It performs well for a portable projector but costs about the same as the BenQ HT2050A, which does a much better job. But for regular movie nights far from an outlet, it works great. Also note that you can save $130 at Amazon right now by activating the instant coupon on the product page. Read our Xgimi Halo Plus review.\nThe BenQ HT2060 replaces our longtime favorite, the HT2050A, which is officially discontinued. It has many similarities, including 1080p resolution, lens shift and great color accuracy. The move to LEDs instead of a traditional lamp has two main benefits: First, the LEDs last the life of the projector, so no more replacing lamps; and second, it offers a rich and lifelike image with impressive color accuracy. The downsides are a reduction in brightness overall, and the HT2060 is about 25% more expensive to purchase. However, because you don't need to replace the lamps, the cost of ownership over the projector's lifetime is far lower compared with the HT2050A. \nHead to head with its predecessor, the older projector still looks great, but overall the HT2060 is a little bit better. If your budget is around $1,000 and you have a light-controlled room, this is the projector to get. If you need some extreme light output, the Epson HC2350 mentioned below doesn't look quite as good but is far brighter.\nThe Optoma UHZ50 uses a blue laser and a yellow phosphor to create some incredibly bright, ultracolorful images. It also has the second-best contrast ratio we've measured from a DLP projector. Also, because it's DLP, it has excellent detail. The zoom range and lens shift are fairly limited, so it won't fit in as many rooms as the Epson 5050 or LS11000, but otherwise it's very good. Read our Optoma UHZ50 Projector review.\nThe tiny P8 serves up a far bigger image than its size suggests. Though in fairness, the handheld size doesn't suggest it could project an image at all -- it looks more like a toy. But it's reasonably bright, has a built-in speaker and costs only $250 or even less. Impressive. \nIt doesn't have a battery, nor does it have any streaming apps. So you'll need to take that into consideration. It does have an HDMI input and a USB connection, so you can connect a streaming stick and get all the streaming apps you could possibly want. There are brighter options and better-looking options, but for the price the P8 is hard to beat. Read our AAXA P8 review.\nIf you're looking for impressive picture quality, good brightness in ambient light, vivid colors and a quality contrast ratio, then the Epson Home Cinema 5050UB is the best overall home theater projector. \nIf you want something less expensive, the best projector for the money is the BenQ HT2050A. It's worth noting that it's being discontinued soon, but its replacement, the HT2060, is excellent and still one of our overall best projector picks. \nThe Epson HC2350 is an extremely bright 4K projector at a great price. It has lens shift, built-in streaming and a compact size. Its price has fallen since it was released, so now it goes head-to-head with another favorite of ours, the 1080p BenQ HT2060 mentioned above.\nThe HC2350 is impressively bright. It's one of the brightest projectors we've ever measured. However, its contrast ratio isn't great, well below average. As a result, its image is more washed out and \""flat\"" compared with some other projectors, notably the aforementioned BenQ. While it's 4K, the HC2350 uses LCDs to create its image, so it's susceptible to motion blur. Because of that, it doesn't always look as sharp as you might expect. If you're ready for 4K and need something with extreme brightness, this is the best option anywhere near $1,000.\nIt's smaller than a six-pack of Coke and equipped with Wi-Fi streaming, a surprisingly loud Bluetooth speaker and even a handle. It offers auto vertical and manual horizontal keystone correction. This portable mini projector powerhouse also has one thing many compact projectors like the Vimgo P10 lack: a built-in battery. This budget projector is an all-in-one entertainment machine that's darn cute, too. It lists for around $550, but you can save $70 when you pick it up from Anker directly and use the promo code WSCPCC8CGG at checkout. \nThe Sony VPL-VW325ES is a thoroughbred among ponies, a Porsche among Volkswagens, an absolute stunner with a price tag to match. The contrast ratio, easily the most important aspect of overall picture quality, is better than that of the Epson 5050, and significantly better than that of any projector which doesn't cost significantly more. And that's saying something, since the Sony itself costs far more than any other projector on this list. It checks the box for gaming with the input lag reduction feature. And with brightness that can go up to 1,500 Lumens, it works well in a bright room as well. If price is no object, the picture quality is incredible.\nSony has discontinued the VW325ES, but you can still find it available new online.\nThe Epson Home Cinema LS11000 is similar to the Epson 5050, but instead of a lamp it uses a laser and phosphor combo to create light. This means even better color, no lamp replacements, faster turn on/off and a more usable dynamic contrast ratio. A more advanced different pixel shifter means better resolution than the 5050 as well. It's more expensive to start, but over the life of the projector they should be about the same. So better picture quality for roughly the same total cost of ownership makes this well worth considering over the 5050. Read our Epson Home Cinema LS11000 review.\nThe EF-12 is a small, highly portable projector that looks a lot like the Anker Nebula Pro and the BenQ GS50, but it fits a slightly different niche. It's easy to tote and doubles as a Bluetooth speaker, but unlike those other two projectors, it can't run on a battery -- it requires AC power. The EF-12's light is created by Epson's \""MicroLaser Array Projection Technology.\"" Yep, laser beams, which deliver a brighter picture than LED-based models like the Nebula and GS50.\n\nPicture quality: Projectors lag behind TVs when it comes to overall picture quality. However, they largely make up for it with absolutely massive images. Want a TV that's 100-inches or more? Only a projector can do that, if you're not ultrarich. Even so, there's a wide range of picture quality even among projectors of a similar price. A projector with a great contrast ratio but only average light output is going to look better than the opposite. However, a brighter projector will be easier to see with some lights on, and can create an even bigger image. \nWhere are you using it?: For light controlled rooms and home theaters, a projector with a high contrast ratio is better than one that prioritizes light output. For mixed-use rooms where it'll be hard or impossible to totally control the ambient light, or if you want an outdoor movie night with an image the size of the side of your house, one that prioritizes light output will be better, because the contrast ratio won't be as noticeable. \nWhat about X spec?: Ignore the specs. Companies claim million-to-one contrast ratios, insane brightness ratings, and even more. But the specs are largely divorced from reality. A claimed 2,000 lumen projector is probably brighter than a 500 lumen projector, but 1,500 and 1,700 lumen projectors are probably the same.\nHow much should you spend?: $1,000 is the sweet spot with projectors, where you can get great picture quality and brightness. Less than that usually requires a compromise of some kind. Some highly portable and battery-powered models are far less. They're not as bright, but they're great for their intended use. Spending more gets you incremental improvements. Above $3,000 there's a big jump in picture quality again, and from there the sky's the limit. Great picture quality, but they're well beyond what we usually test.\nWhat features should you look for?: If you're connecting the projector to an audio system (and you should, either receiver/speakers or soundbar), then you don't really need many features in the projector itself. Just get one that has great picture quality and high brightness. Lens shift and zoom are handy if you want more flexibility in placement. If you're looking for some kind of \""all-in-one\"" device with speakers, make sure it has a full version of Android TV inside for streaming, otherwise you'll want to connect a streaming stick like Roku. This is because many highly portable and budget models use the Aptoide store, which won't have as many streaming app options, and those it does have often have compromised functionality (no HD, difficult to navigate, and so on). \nCNET puts projectors through a rigorous and unbiased testing process that's the culmination of more than two decades of projector reviews. We use specialized test equipment, including a Photo Research spectroradiometer, a Minolta LS-100 luminance meter and an AEMC CA813 illuminance meter. The data is collected and collated by Portrait Displays CalMan Ultimate software, which helps us evaluate every PJ we review. Every lamp-based projector is \""burned in\"" for 50 hours before measuring, and all projectors are initially set up using their most accurate color temp and color modes. Test patterns, sent from CalMan, are then used to adjust the various picture settings so the projector looks its best before measurement and evaluation. Contrast ratios are measured in each lamp and iris mode (when available). Once the projectors are fully set up and objectively measured, we watch a variety of content, including TV, movies, and games, both with the projector by itself, and compared side-by-side with two direct competitors. \nBroadly speaking, we're looking for the three picture quality aspects: contrast ratio, overall light output and color reproduction. Contrast ratio is the most important part of any projector's performance. It's the difference between the darkest part of the image and the brightest. While certain TV technologies, like OLED, can create a black that's the actual absence of light, no projector technology can do this. Because of this, contrast ratios with projectors are far lower. It's the difference between a washed out and \""flat\"" image and one that's more lifelike and \""pops.\"" The better projectors will have a measured contrast ratio in the thousands. Most are between 500-1000:1. \nLight output is the second most important factor, because it's not only how bright the image appears on your wall, but also how big an image you can produce. Most modern projectors are significantly brighter than projectors from even 10 years ago. We measure brightness in candelas per square meter (cd/m2) and then convert to estimated lumens for ease of comparison. It's important to note that we use the most accurate color temperature mode for our brightness comparisons, but we'll note when a less-accurate mode is significantly brighter. Most of the projectors we test are between 1,000-2,000 lumens, with battery-powered models far less, and some specialized projectors even higher.\nColor accuracy is the last major factor. No projector can truly take advantage of HDR or wide color gamut, but some can do more than others. Generally, we're satisfied with accurate colors, but adding HDR effects is a bonus. Most home theater projectors we test are fairly accurate. Budget models, those that prioritize brightness over everything, and PJs from newcomers to the projector space, often have wildly inaccurate colors that result in a very unnatural image.\nOther factors, like video processing and HDR processing, are evaluated in the viewing tests. These are rarely a major factor in projector performance, but some models still use older chips that have issues.\nThe best projector will have a high contrast ratio, high brightness and great color. Those are difficult to do at the same time, but as long as the balance works and it looks better than its competitors at a similar price, it's a winner.\nFor more info, check out how CNET tests projectors.\n*See review for more details\n**As measured. See how CNET tests projectors for details.\nBenQ GS50: The GS50 is a lunch box-size 1080p projector with a built-in battery. You can even use it as a Bluetooth speaker. However, it's dimmer than the Xgimi Halo Plus for similar money, so we recommend that one instead.\nSamsung Freestyle: The small, cylindrical Freestyle is an interesting idea, but it comes up short. It's about the size of a Bluetooth speaker and in fact can double as one, and the Freestyle can pivot on its stand to project an image at any height on walls and even the ceiling. Its built-in streaming is far better implemented than with most portable projectors. However, it lacks a battery and its performance is average, at best. Worse, its price is a good 50% higher than it should be based on how it looks and performs. Read our Samsung Freestyle review.\nXiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2: Another relatively expensive projector we didn't love, the Xiaomi at least has a gorgeous, Apple-like design going for it. We appreciated the compact size, 1080p resolution and built-in Android TV streaming, but the cons outweigh the pros. It's relatively dim, especially for the price, and it lacks both a built-in battery and compatibility with a USB power source, so it's not truly portable. Read our Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 review. \nEpson Home Cinema 880: The 880 is one of Epson's less expensive home projectors, but it still puts out a remarkable amount of light. That and the price make it tempting. The contrast ratio is terrible, however, so the overall image quality is weak. Read our Epson Home Cinema 880 review. \nLG HU810PW: The HU810PW is a higher-end, laser-powered projector with 4K resolution that's able to create some lovely, colorful images. It's also quiet and sports an attractive, boxy case. The contrast ratio is quite poor, so it doesn't look nearly as good overall as other projectors in its price range. Read our LG HU810PW review. \nAnker Nebula Solar Portable: The Solar Portable is a portable projector with a built-in battery that lasts three hours. It sports 1080p resolution, but it's not very bright and the contrast isn't great. Though the Anker Mars II Pro has its own issues, overall it's the better option for the same money. Read our Anker Nebula Solar Portable review. \nAnker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K: Since it has a handle and it's a compact size, the Cosmos Laser 4K is technically portable, but it's hardly mini at more than 10 pounds. There's also no battery, so you'll need to plug it in. It's nice and bright, but the other downsides -- lack of zoom, average overall image quality and a steep price for what you get -- keep it off this list. Read our Anker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K Projector review.\nMini projectors are projectors small enough to hold easily in one hand. They're incredibly portable, but they're not as bright as their larger counterparts, nor do they look as good. Overall, we like the AAXA P8 for its small size and high performance for its category. \nFor more options, check out our list of the best portable mini projectors.\nIf you want to move movie night outdoors, you have a few options. We generally recommend, when possible, to use a regular home projector and run an extension cord. Home projectors will offer far better, brighter images, for the same or less money than portable projectors. \nIf you want to go fully cordless, we like the Xgimi Halo Plus. It's fairly expensive, but it offers decent battery life and image quality. \nFor more options, check out our list of the best outdoor projectors.\nLCD and Digital Light Processing projectors are the most common technologies. Higher-end projectors often use LCOS, or liquid crystal on silicon, designs. These are marketed as SXRD and DILA. LCOS is superior to LCD and DLP in almost every way, but it's significantly more expensive. \nLCD (used almost exclusively by Epson) and DLP both have their strengths and weaknesses. DLP is typically sharper, LCD often brighter. However, both technologies offer bright, sharp images. It's more down to the specific model of projector than specific technologies. \nYou can use any flat surface to project your image. However, don't expect it to be the best surface for a projector. Any and all tiny bumps in a wall, for example, will be visible as extra \""noise\"" in the image. This can be distracting. If you want the best image quality from your projector, even an inexpensive screen is a far better option. This is because projector screens tend to brighten the image noticeably and create a smooth surface that best shows off your TV program, movie or game. \nPortable models are expensive for their performance, but they can work where there's no outlet. If you don't plan on ever using the projector away from your house, a traditional projector will be far brighter and can be used outside. Just remember to bring it in when you're done.\nWe independently review everything we recommend. When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.

Her specialty is video projectors, so she spends a lot of time alone in dark rooms.\nWe’ve added the BenQ X500i as another pick for the best short-throw projector.\nDifferent projectors are designed for different uses, and they can range in price from a couple hundred dollars to well into the five-figure range. Choosing the right model for your needs can be a daunting task, and we’re here to help.\nBelow is an overview of the top picks from our various projector guides. We have recommendations for premium 4K movie projectors, bright living-room projectors, budget home theater projectors, and more.\nWhen shopping for projectors, don’t rely on the specs—especially the claimed brightness, which is often exaggerated.\nIf you want a big screen, you need a bright projector. Tiny projectors are not bright enough to deliver a big-screen, cinema-like experience.\nProjectors, like TVs, are rarely set up to look their best right out of the box. Look for a picture mode called Cinema, Movie, or Natural.\nWe have projector recommendations for home theaters, living rooms, small spaces, outdoors, and portable use.\n\nIf you’re not sure where to begin your projector search, we recommend reading about how to pick the right projector for your viewing needs. In summary, you have three important questions to ask at the start: What do you plan to use the projector for? What type of room will you use it in? How big of a screen do you want?\nThere’s a huge difference in price and performance between a 4K projector designed for a big-screen home theater and a portable mini projector designed to be an everyday TV replacement. Some projectors excel with movies in a completely dark room, while others are better for sports or gaming in a room with some ambient light.\nGenerally, the bigger the screen you want, the brighter your projector must be to produce a satisfyingly rich image. Once you have a general idea of the projector’s intended use, it’s easier to zero in on a specific choice.\nThe LS11000 is a great 4K laser projector that can deliver a big, bright, beautiful image, and it has almost all the features you need—except 3D support.\nIf you want to set up a high-performance home theater in a basement or spare room and need a 4K projector that can handle high dynamic range video and wide-color-gamut material, choose the Epson Home Cinema LS11000. This LCD laser projector offers a combination of performance and features that you won’t find in any other projector priced lower than $5,000. It’s an excellent 4K movie projector, but it also looks great with games, sports, and HDTV when some room lights are on.\nRead more about the Epson LS11000 in our guide to the best 4K projector.\nThis projector produces a bright, rich-looking image with more accurate color than most competitors can offer. It’s easy to set up and quiet in operation, but it lacks features like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nIf you want to create a big-screen movie experience at home on a modest budget, the BenQ HT2060 is the best performer in the $1,000-and-under price range.\nRead more about this pick and others in our guide to the best budget projector for a home theater.\nThis 4K projector’s high light output, good-sounding speaker, and Android TV system make it a nice option for a living room.\nThe BenQ TK860i’s high brightness, rich color, razor-sharp image, and solid HDR performance are well suited for everyday TV and movie watching in a brighter viewing environment. It can’t compete with the best 4K home theater projector in contrast and accuracy, but its high brightness makes it a better choice for use in a living room or family room where you can’t block out all the light. If you'd prefer an LCD projector for a living room, the Epson Home Cinema 3800 is a great option, but it does not have a full 4K resolution.\nYou can read more about this projector in our full guide to 4K projectors.\nThis compact, 1080p projector offers good image brightness and contrast, above-average sound, easy setup, and a built-in battery. But mounting it on a tripod may prove tricky.\nIf you need a small, compact projector that you can easily move around your home, the Nebula Mars 3 Air offers almost everything we could ask for in this type of projector. The Mars 3 Air is an LED projector that has a 1080p resolution and supports HDR video in the HDR10 format (though it isn’t bright enough to show off what HDR can do). It also includes a built-in battery, built-in Google TV and speakers, automatic focus and image shaping, and support for Bluetooth audio.\nYou can read more about this projector and others in our full guide to portable mini projectors.\nThis 4K projector casts a larger image from a shorter distance, so it’s good for smaller spaces. As long as the room has light control, this projector’s excellent contrast, color, and detail make it good for all content types.\nPrice reflects in cart with free BenQ membership\nThis 1080p projector can produce a 100-inch image from less than 5 feet away. But the picture quality isn’t quite as good as that of the X500i.\nIn order to create a large image, most projectors need to be positioned far from the screen. This distance is called the throw distance, and it can be anywhere from 8 to 15 feet, depending on the projector and desired image size. Short-throw projectors are convenient for small rooms or other situations where space is limited. Both the 4K BenQ X500i and the 1080p BenQ HT2150ST can sit much closer to the screen than standard projectors.\nYou can read more about the BenQ X500i in our 4K projector guide and the BenQ HT2150ST in our guide to the best budget projector for a home theater.\nThis portable 1080p projector offers the good brightness, long battery life, and convenient features we want in an outdoor projector, but it’s bulkier than we’d prefer.\nWhile nearly any projector can work for the occasional backyard movie night, a more rugged and portable model is advisable if you plan to use it outdoors a lot. The Nebula Mars 3 is the brightest portable projector we’ve tested, and while its 1080p resolution doesn’t measure up to a 4K projector (currently there are no battery-powered 4K options) it still provides good contrast and decent accuracy. Its built-in speakers performed admirably, and outdoor-friendly features like weatherproofing make it an ideal option for the perfect backyard movie night.\nYou can read more about this projector in our guide to the best outdoor projector.\nUltra-short-throw (UST) projectors are often marketed as TV replacements because they can deliver a massive image from a very short distance and have a footprint smaller than any TV. But the truth is, these are still projectors, and expensive ones at that.\nWe tested four UST projectors at varying prices and performance levels and concluded that the vast majority of people are better off getting either a large TV or a traditional projector. You’ll either get better performance or spend less—oftentimes both. You can read more about this in our piece Is an Ultra-Short-Throw Projector a Good Substitute for a Big-Screen TV?\nThis inexpensive screen offers performance comparable to that of others costing much more, plus it’s easy to install.\nMost modern projectors are bright enough to throw a decent image on just about any close-enough-to-white surface, but you won’t get accurate colors without a proper screen. A screen has less texture than a wall, plus it will add pop to the image, because paint almost always has less gain (that is, it reflects less light) than a screen, meaning the image will appear dimmer than is ideal.\nThe Silver Ticket STR Series performs as well as screens costing thousands of dollars. You can read about screen materials and our testing methods in our guide to the best projector screen.\nThis outdoor screen’s rigid frame, highly reflective screen, and adjustable height make it the best choice for creating a movie-like outdoor-theater experience. But it carries a high price.\nIf you don’t need an adjustable-height frame or an extra-large screen size, this rigid frame uses the same material as the pricier Yard Master Plus.\nWhile projecting an image against an outdoor wall or garage door is an option, a dedicated projector screen like the Elite Screens Yard Master Plus or the Elite Screens Yard Master 2 provides better video quality. Both screens are made from the same ISF-certified material, which did a great job of preserving image brightness and color accuracy in our testing. Assembly for their respective frames is straightforward, using button snaps to attach the screen to the frame.\nThe Yard Master 2 comes in sizes from 58 to 135 inches diagonally (in a 16:9 shape), while the Yard Master Plus comes in sizes from 100 to 200 inches. In addition, the Plus features an adjustable-height frame.\nIf you’re interested in an inflatable screen or something even more economical, check out our guide on outdoor projector screens.\nThis is the closest thing to the perfect projector mount we’ve used.\nIf you want to get your projector up and out of the way, you need a mount. The Peerless-AV PRGS-UNV Projector Mount is one of our favorites due to its flexibility and how easy it is to set up correctly. The mounting arms are highly adjustable and removable, so it can handle anything from a tiny DLP projector to the gigantic JVC D-ILA projectors that most mounts cannot fit. The dials let you easily make small adjustments to the projector to get it level with the screen and produce the best-quality image without much work. After years of using this mount and going through dozens of tested projectors, we have yet to find one that the Peerless-AV cannot handle.\nYou’ll probably need some speakers, AV sources, and other accessories. Check out our recommendations in “The Best Gear for a Home Theater System.”\nFor a home theater projector that you will use mostly in a dark room, we recommend at least 1,000 ANSI lumens for a 100-inch screen. If you plan to use the projector in a room with more ambient light, you’ll want to go brighter: at least 1,500 ANSI lumens (ideally 2,000 or more). The larger the screen size you want, the brighter the projector needs to be to produce a satisfying image. Manufacturers’ claimed brightness specifications are usually exaggerated, so it’s best to rely on actual measured results from trusted reviewers. Some manufacturers use LEDs instead of traditional bulbs as the light source in their projectors, and they list the brightness rating in “LED lumens” instead of ANSI lumens to give a higher number.\nThis depends on how much you want the projected image to fill your field of view. Some people like to sit closer in the movie theater so it feels more immersive, while others prefer to sit farther back. It’s the same at home. Experts generally recommend a viewing distance that fills between 30 and 36 degrees of your field of view, and you can use this calculator to help find a good seating distance for your screen size.\nIf you watch a lot of 4K content and want the most detailed image you can get, a 4K projector is the way to go. The step up in resolution from 1080p to 4K can be more obvious on a projector than it is on most TVs, due to the larger screen size. However, native 4K projectors are very expensive and usually reserved for the most ardent home theater fans. Most affordable “4K” projectors use some type of pixel-shifting technology to reproduce a 4K image, which can be very effective and really is good enough for most people. Also, once you get past a certain seating distance, your eyes may not be able to see the difference between 4K and 1080p. Most 4K projectors also support high dynamic range video, but we think this feature is less important on projectors, since none of them are bright enough to do HDR properly.\nAdrienne Maxwell\nAdrienne Maxwell is the supervising editor of Wirecutter's audio/video team, covering everything from headphones to TVs. She has been a writer, editor, and reviewer in the consumer electronics industry for 20 years, and previously served as the executive editor of Home Theater Magazine and the managing editor of HomeTheaterReview.com.\nIf you’re looking for a more rugged, portable projector to take outdoors, the easy-to-use Nebula Mars 3 offers good brightness and a long battery life.\nA portable mini projector doesn’t perform as well as a good TV or home-theater projector, but the Nebula Mars 3 Air ably blends performance and convenience.\nThe Epson LS11000 4K laser projector delivers a big, beautiful image, works well in a variety of lighting conditions, and has most of the features you need.\nThe BenQ HT2060’s good contrast, bright output, and impressive color accuracy make it our pick for the best budget home theater projector.\nWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.

All that screen time can add up. But blue-violet light-filtering computer glasses may be able to help. \nWhat are blue-light computer glasses and how do they filter blue-violet light? What is blue light? What kind of blue light glasses are there? Our guide will help you select the best computer glasses for you.\nComputer glasses have specially coated lenses designed to help you focus, relaxing your eyes while using a computer. Prescription and non-prescription computer glasses are available.\nIf you experience digital eye strain from viewing small print on a screen and have symptoms like eye fatigue, burning or itching eyes, headaches or blurred vision consider wearing computer glasses with an intermediate distance prescription to increase your visual comfort.\nNot sure if your monitor is far enough from your eyes? If your screen is about an arm’s length away, it’s the perfect distance from your eyes.\nSEE RELATED: Do blue light glasses work?\nElectronics like smartphones, computers and TVs give off LED blue light, which is part of the visible light spectrum, with wavelengths from about 400 nm to 495 nm. Not all screens are LED-based, and the specific wavelength emitted may vary by manufacturer or device setting. \nBlue light can be divided into two bands, blue-violet light (400-455 nm) and blue-turquoise light (465-495 nm). Sleep/wake cycles are impacted by blue-turquoise light, not blue-violet light. The main source of blue light (including blue-violet light) is sunlight, even indoors. \nComputer glasses make it more comfortable to look at your screen and easier to focus on the work at hand, no matter the time of day. But remember that clear blue-light computer glasses typically filter blue-violet light, not blue-turquoise light (which impacts circadian rhythm). \nComputer glasses can be made with:\nPrescription or non-prescription lenses\nDifferent lens tints to filter different percentages of blue-violet light \nAnti-glare and/or scratch-resistant lens coatings\nThe best computer glasses for you depends on your overall vision and the type of work you’re doing. \nIf you already have prescription glasses and want to start wearing computer glasses, you’ll need to order a new pair. Blue-violet light filters cannot be added to your current lenses but they can easily be applied when new glasses are being made. \nIf you shop online, you can find a pair with prescription lenses for as low as $31. Pricing varies, depending on the frames you order, your prescription strength, the lens upgrades you want, and the type of lenses you need (such as single vision or progressives).\nIf you don’t need vision correction, prefer to wear contacts or don’t want to spend much on a new pair of prescription glasses, “plano” computer glasses (with non-prescription lenses) are an inexpensive way to help filter blue-violet light. \nOnline retailers offer many frame styles and lens coating options to fit your personal style and budget. \nComputer glasses come in a variety of lens tints and coatings.\nHere’s how lens tints and coatings filter blue-violet light:\nLens tints\nIf you’re looking for some serious blue light filtering, invest in a pair of dark yellow- or amber-tinted lenses. The amber and yellow tints absorb much more of the blue light before it reaches your eyes. \nBlue light glasses are also sometimes called blue light-blocking glasses or blue light filter glasses or even blue blockers. Even though blue light glasses are often referred to as ‘blue-light blocking,’ it’s more accurate to say that they filter light.\nThe only way to completely filter blue-turquoise light is with a dark amber/orange tint, which can cause cosmetic and visual issues. Not all products that claim to block blue light will filter blue-violet light or blue-turquoise light. Ensure your blue light glasses filter the correct wavelength for your desired purpose.\nLens coatings\nTinted lenses aren’t for everyone. But there are clear lens options that provide blue-violet light filtering. Lenses with 10% or 20% filtering can appear almost clear. These can be the right choice if you wear them all day. \nAnti-reflective coating is also beneficial for computer glasses, since it prevents screen glare from irritating or distracting your vision. \nREADY TO SHOP FOR COMPUTER GLASSES? Find an optical store near you or shop online.\nWith so many blue-violet light-filtering glasses on the market, it can be tough to narrow down your choices. Here are five of the best computer glasses for a variety of needs:\nPeepers Showbiz, $29\nThe clear lenses in these fashionable oversized frames include a barely perceptible tint that filters more than 40% blue-violet light. Peepers Showbiz computer glasses also have anti-reflective and anti-scratch coatings. \nThe sturdy, lightweight polycarbonate frame comes in five different colors: Gray Tortoise/Pink; Blue Quartz/Blue; Sand Quartz/Yellow; Black Marble/Black; and Tortoise/Green. Lenses are available in magnification strengths from +1.0 to +3.0.\nRay-Ban Jackie Ohh Blue-Light Clear, $163 \nThe Jackie Ohh computer glasses have clear non-prescription lenses that filter blue-violet light, eliminate glare and provide 100% UV protection. The flattering and stylish cat-eye frames come in the color Polished Havana. \nIf you love the Ray-Ban look but need prescription lenses, check out Ray-Ban’s Everglasses collection for more blue-violet light-filtering glasses options.\nGunnar Intercept, starting at $74.99 (non-prescription) or $224.99 (prescription)  \nThese highly rated retro black frames come in four different blue-violet light-filtering lens tints for indoor/outdoor use: \nClear – 35% filtered \nAmber – 65% filtered \nAmber Max – 98% filtered\nAmber-React – 65%/90% filtered\nGunnar Intercept lenses have scratch-resistant and anti-reflective coatings and are available with or without a prescription. Lenses can accommodate prescriptions ranging from -6.0 to +5.0.\nFoster Grant Aruba Kids Blue Light Glasses, $28 \nFoster Grant’s computer glasses for kids filter up to 30% of blue-violet light and provide 100% UVA/UVB protection. With fun Monkey Monkey branding, the tropical frames come with impact-resistant, non-prescription lenses and a carrying case so kids can work on electronic devices away from home. \nAnd, for every pair of Foster Grant glasses you buy, the company donates a pair of reading glasses to a person in an underserved community.\nOakley NXTLVL, $208 \nOakley NXTLVL glasses are designed specifically for adult gamers, with a large, square lens shape and an unobstructed view to take you to the next level when your game intensifies. \nOakley’s Prizm Gaming prescription lenses filter up to 40% of blue-violet light for an easier-on-the-eyes gaming experience. The frame’s temple design, nose pads and earsocks hold the glasses comfortably in place while wearing headsets.\nThey may be at a higher price point, but if you’re a frequent gamer, the investment may be worth the higher cost. Want to scale back on the price? Check out some of the other options in Oakley’s gaming collection.\nIn most cases, wearing blue light glasses all day is safe and unlikely to cause problems. You may want to experiment with different types and levels of filtering to see what works best for you.\nIf you’ve experienced symptoms of digital eye strain from viewing a screen at close distances, it’s best to see your eye doctor and get a comprehensive eye exam to make sure there’s nothing else causing your symptoms. Ask your eye doctor if computer glasses could help make your workdays more comfortable.\nREAD NEXT: What is asthenopia?\nPage published on Friday, January 10, 2020\nPage updated on Friday, January 5, 2024\nMedically reviewed on Tuesday, June 20, 2023\nSchedule an exam\n\n                    Find an eyecare professional and book online in minutes!\n                \nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCompany\nCountries\n\n              A collaborative learning community for graphic designers at any stage, focused on education, mentorship, and mutual support.\n            \n\n    Just curious if it helps. I recently got a full time design position in an office (as opposed to freelance work from home) and the eye strain is for real. There aren't really many opportunities to get up and do other things besides lunch break and occasional bathroom breaks. Been looking into 'computer glasses' as an option but wanted to see if they were worth it first. Thanks!\n  \n\n    EDIT: I wear contacts, already know I have bad eye sight.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you get a headache after staring at your monitor for hours at a time? Computer glasses might help. Here's how to pick a pair that works best for you, along with some of our favorites.\nI’ve been PCMag’s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I’ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I’m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I’m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).\nThe more time we spend staring at screens, whether at the office or at home, the more vulnerable we are to eye strain. You've probably already heard how blue light can hurt your eyes and affect your sleep, but you might not know all the ways to help reduce its impact on your health. Below, we list a few blue-light-blocking glasses and software solutions that might alleviate eye strain, as well as explain some habits that can help. We also tell you which brands you should avoid.\nGunnar is known best for its blue-light-blocking computer glasses that target gamers. If you go to major video game events like PAX, you've probably seen a pair.\nGunnar offers a variety of frames and tint types, including the slight clear lens that blocks 35% of blue light and doesn't tint other colors too much; the more intense amber lens that blocks 65% of blue light; and even transition lenses that stay tinted indoors and get darker like sunglasses when you're outside. These glasses are available with or without a prescription. If you're farsighted, though, know that \""Gunnar-Focus\"" glasses have a slight magnifying factor that can be a bit disorienting; if you don't want that, make sure you order \""Natural-Focus\"" lenses.\nWe've tried out several pairs of Gunnar glasses, and each pair we've tested has been well-made, sturdy, and comfortable.\nJins is a Japanese glasses company that makes a variety of blue-light-blocking lenses. There are two Jins Screen lens treatments: Jins Screen Daily Use and Jins Screen Heavy Use. \nThe regular Jins Screen Daily Use models feature a subtle tint, while Jins Screen Heavy Use glasses opt for a slightly stronger, greenish tint that blocks more blue light and is intended for heavy screen use. You can add either to most frames. The frames themselves are quite nice, but they can get pretty expensive, especially if you want a model that's actually made in Japan.\nWarby Parker is one of the more popular fashion-focused glasses retailers because of its home try-on policy. You pick five frames online to try on at home, the company ships them to you, and you choose which ones to keep. The frames are made well, reasonably priced, and support blue-light-filtering lenses. The coating is an extra $50, which puts most glasses at around $145 (or less if you have an eligible insurance plan). You can also get anti-fatigue lenses for $100 more, which add a slight magnification effect to the lower part of the lens. We can't speak to their effectiveness, however.\nZenni is a glasses brand that lets you order inexpensive frames and lenses online. If you have your prescription, you can simply enter the numbers into a form, and your glasses will arrive a few weeks later. With prices starting at $7, I've sworn by Zenni for stocking up on backup glasses, though its pricier frames and lenses are generally pretty well-made, too.\nZenni offers Blokz, its own blue-light-blocking lens technology. Blokz lenses start at $17, so you can get prescription blue-light-blocking glasses for as little as $25. You can also get photochromatic Blokz that darken in the sunlight, and Zenni recently released its EyeQLenz lenses that filter blue light and infrared light, and have photochromatic properties (though in my tests they don't get sunglasses-dark).\nYou can get inexpensive blue-light-blocking glasses at Amazon and other retailers, though you won't have the benefit of prescription lenses. We also haven't reviewed any of these glasses, so we can't attest to their lens or frame quality. We have, however, noticed an interesting pattern: Lots of them are the same.\nThe glasses above appear to be identical to several of the glasses a few entries below them when you search for blue-light-blocking models on Amazon. We suspect most of these glasses come from the same factory and that the different brand names don't mean much. If you don't recognize the brand and the company doesn't appear to have a dedicated website, expect a generic experience.\nYou don't need glasses to reduce blue light on your screen. iPhones, Macs, PCs, and most Android phones have night modes that significantly warm up the white balance of the screen to reduce eye strain. On Windows 10 and 11, it's called Night Light, and on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS it's called Night Shift. You can set these modes to work on a schedule or based on sunrise and sunset times.\nYou can also use f.lux, free software for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, which does the same job.\nIronically, the popular-in-drug-stores brand BluBlocker is not advisable for reducing blue light when staring at a screen.\nBluBlockers are sunglasses, and their tints are too strong for comfortably looking at your monitor. If you use too strong a tint, you can strain your eyes in the other direction, forcing them to deal with too little light instead of too much.\nOn the most basic level, blue light is exactly what it sounds like: light that's blue. That's not the full picture, though, and this is where light and color theory comes into play, along with concepts like color temperature, Planck's Constant, and the black body radiation curve. Without going too far into the weeds, you simply need to understand one fact about light: The color white isn't universal.\nThere is no singular white, but rather a whole range of visible light that counts as white. Depending on the lighting conditions and what is radiating and reflecting light, white light can appear yellow (warm) or blue (cool) in color. For instance, the light that comes from an incandescent LED light bulb is warmer than the light that comes from a computer monitor. This effect is called color temperature and is measured in kelvin (K).\nWhat we perceive as white light shifts along a range of about 2,700K to 7,000K. Confusingly, warmer light has a lower color temperature than cooler light, with the almost fiery glow of tungsten hitting around 2,800K and overcast sunlight hitting about 6,000K. Computer monitors typically set white at a cooler temperature to emulate natural sunlight, close to 6,500K. That means the light coming from your screen is quite blue; you can notice this difference if you compare a web page with a white background to a warm light bulb.\nBlue light is often cited as the culprit for eye strain and even eye damage, so, naturally, the solution should be to warm up that light before it hits your eyes.\nHere's where it gets tricky: Claims from the manufacturers of blue-light-blocking glasses don't necessarily hold up to medical scrutiny. Essentially, blue light can't directly damage your eyesight. The American Academy of Opthalmology (AAO) notes that ultraviolet radiation can damage eyes but that computer monitors and other screens don't emit that kind of radiation. The whites are cool, but they aren't harmful. In fact, the AAO doesn't recommend any special eyewear for computer use.\nThis doesn't mean you should ignore the effects of staring at a screen all day. While the radiation might not hurt your eyes, fixating on a powerful light source a few inches or a few feet from your eyes for long periods of time can cause eye strain. Your eyes can become dry, irritated, or blurry, and you can even get headaches after you've looked at screens for hours. Blue-light-blocking technology can help reduce that strain by making the light appear more soothing and less bright.\nThe AAO recommends the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, you should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to give your eyes a break. It's a good habit to get into, but it isn't always realistic, and it isn't the only thing you can do to help your eyes.\nI sometimes get light-sensitive headaches, and I've found that tinted lenses can help reduce their frequency. For that, blue-light-blocking glasses are useful. They warm up the light by blocking out some wavelengths to give your eyes a rest. Their real value is relieving eye strain, not the promise of simply blocking blue light.\nShopping for glasses can be stressful. Luckily, we have a guide to sites that let you shop for frames and lenses at home. We note which services offer blue-light-filtering lenses, too.\nAdvertisement\nSign up for Lab Report to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.\n\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Each year for testing, she runs over 120 dish cycles and washes 120 loads of laundry. \nOur original runner-up pick, Persil ProClean Original Liquid Laundry Detergent, is now called Persil Original Liquid Detergent Everyday Clean. The formula remains the same.\nWhether you regularly face serious stains or simply want your grubby laundry fresh and clean, a good laundry detergent can do it all—without irritating your skin or your fabrics.\nWe pitted more than 35 detergents against a slew of stains and odors (on all kinds of laundry, from stained T-shirts to smelly socks). Tide Ultra Oxi Powder Laundry Detergent and Tide Free & Gentle Liquid Laundry Detergent consistently and effectively removed a wider variety of stains than the competition.\nThis powerful powder dissolves swiftly and completely, eliminates many tough stains, and leaves a light scent. But it’s less effective on greasy stains than our liquid picks.\nThis fragrance- and dye-free liquid was the most well-rounded liquid detergent we tested, tackling a variety of stains and odors well.\nThis liquid detergent was among the top performers in stain removal, but its strong scent lingers long after clothes have dried.\nWith store pickup or Walmart+ (150 ounces)\nThese fragrance-free pods are convenient, strong cleaners. But they don’t have quite the stain-fighting power of our top picks, and you can’t use them to pretreat.\nThis hyper-concentrated liquid detergent is an effective stain remover, with cleaning power that rivals our top picks. It’s free from many potential irritants and comes in a recyclable aluminum bottle, but it’s expensive.\nWe assessed a variety of detergent types, including liquids, powders, pods, and sheets.\nOur tests evaluated how well each detergent cleaned a variety of stains like sebum (body oil), red wine, butter, and blood.\nWe washed T-shirts stained with bacon grease and sniffed the results to see how effectively each detergent eradicated odors.\nWe considered each detergent’s scent, favoring unscented versions or those with mild fragrances.\nThis powerful powder dissolves swiftly and completely, eliminates many tough stains, and leaves a light scent. But it’s less effective on greasy stains than our liquid picks.\nWiping out nearly every type of stain that came its way, Tide Ultra Oxi Powder Laundry Detergent was hands down the best powder detergent we tested.\nThis light-scented detergent knocked out a variety of stubborn stains in our testing, easily removing blood, grass, dirt, and sebum (body oil). It’s the only detergent we assessed that nearly eliminated an egg-based, turmeric-infused stain, and it fully removed the scent of bacon grease.\nHowever, this detergent didn’t clean greasy stains as well as our liquid picks, and the box can be heavy and unwieldy.\nAdvertisement\nThis fragrance- and dye-free liquid was the most well-rounded liquid detergent we tested, tackling a variety of stains and odors well.\nTide Free & Gentle Liquid Laundry Detergent stands out for its stain elimination power, dye- and fragrance-free formula, and wide availability (some of the free and clear formulas we tested are harder to find).\nSome other detergents cleaned specific stains better (including red wine and tea), but Tide Free & Gentle liquid detergent did a consistently excellent job overall of removing stains—particularly grease- and oil-based messes—and tackling odors.\nThis liquid detergent was among the top performers in stain removal, but its strong scent lingers long after clothes have dried.\nWith store pickup or Walmart+ (150 ounces)\nPersil Original Liquid Detergent Everyday Clean performed very well on all kinds of stains, tackling tea, cocoa, and a chocolate-based dessert stain particularly well.\nIts strong, lingering scent, however, can be polarizing. (It does come in a fragrance-free formula, though it didn’t clean quite as well as the original.)\nThese fragrance-free pods are convenient, strong cleaners. But they don’t have quite the stain-fighting power of our top picks, and you can’t use them to pretreat.\nTide Pods Free & Gentle Laundry Detergent cleaned very well in our testing, tackling grass and pig blood with ease. But they didn’t perform quite as strongly as our top powder and liquid picks.\nThese concentrated, single-dose pods are light and easy to use, and they may appeal to those who find it difficult to lug or pour out bottles or boxes of detergent.\nPods take some of the guesswork out of dosing detergent, but they don’t allow you to precisely adjust the amount for larger or smaller loads, or pretreat stains. These pods are the smallest of the most effective pods we tested, which makes it easier to avoid using too much detergent for a smaller load or to add a second pod for larger ones.\nTide Free & Gentle pods do not contain dyes and are fragrance free.\nThis hyper-concentrated liquid detergent is an effective stain remover, with cleaning power that rivals our top picks. It’s free from many potential irritants and comes in a recyclable aluminum bottle, but it’s expensive.\nDirty Labs Bio Enzyme Laundry Detergent Free & Clear is almost as good as the cleaning power of larger name-brand competitors in our testing—including our picks.\nThe hyper-concentrated formula calls for smaller doses than our other picks, which can take some getting used to. It doesn’t contain dyes, fragrance, or many other common potential irritants.\nThe detergent comes in recyclable aluminum packaging and with a reusable silicone beaker for measuring.\nAdvertisement\nStaff writer Andrea Barnes covers large cleaning appliances, including washing machines and dryers and dishwashers. She also wrote our guide to dishwasher detergent and provides tips for getting the most out of your dishwasher and laundry appliances.\nWe’ve been evaluating laundry detergent since 2013. For this guide, we did the following:\nLaundry detergents come in a variety of forms, including liquids, powders, pods, and sheets. Along with differing in how convenient they are to use, these types vary in cleaning features and strengths. Here’s an overview:\nThe most popular form of laundry detergent, liquid detergents can be measured exactly and their doses are easily adjustable. Liquids work well in all water temperatures, including cold (which we used exclusively in our testing). Liquid laundry detergent is an especially good choice for oil- or grease-based stains; a liquid formula can penetrate oily stains (and fabric) better than a powder paste can.\nMost liquid detergents contain stain-busting enzymes, though some do not. Often labeled as “wash” or “laundry soap,” nonenzymatic detergents rely primarily on surfactants and are similar to castile or other oil-based soaps. We’ve found that although they clean fine in warm water, they don’t clean as effectively in cold water as enzymatic detergents do, and they can leave soap scum and other residues in the machine.\nPowder detergents are made primarily of the same ingredients as liquid detergents, and they tend to clean soil-based stains like mud, clay, and peat better than liquids. In our testing, powder detergents also tackled stains from tannins (red wine, tea) and other natural pigments (beta-carotene, turmeric, grass) effectively. This is likely because powder detergents often contain sodium percarbonate—the main ingredient in OxiClean—which is delivered most effectively in powder form and rarely found in liquid detergents. (A liquid solution will hit a point where no additional sodium percarbonate can dissolve, chemical engineer Tre Wright explained, thus limiting the amount it can contain. None of our liquid picks have sodium percarbonate.)\nPowders can be a challenge to dispense neatly. They don’t always dissolve well in cold water, but some newer powders (such as our pick) are designed to dissolve rapidly and completely. Powder detergent is sometimes considered to be harsher on fabrics, causing dyes to fade more easily. But according to fabric care experts, color fading in laundry washed with powder detergent is likely due to residue from using too much detergent.\nLaundry pods (also called unit doses, packs, discs, or tablets) typically contain a single dose of liquid laundry detergent encased in a water-soluble polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA/PVOH) film. Some pods contain separate chambers of additional stain- or odor-fighting boosters, which combine with the main detergent when the pod’s casing dissolves in water.\nAlthough the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) includes PVA/PVOH on its Safer Chemical Ingredients List and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) recommends cosmetic and cleaning products that contain PVA/PVOH, some are wary of its environmental impact. PVA/PVOH is technically biodegradable, but it takes time to fully break down, and extensive research isn’t available on its long-term biodegradation.\nPods are convenient and low mess, taking most of the guesswork out of dosing detergent. They are light and easy to carry, which could be helpful for those with limited mobility or strength, or people who tote their wash to a laundromat or shared laundry room. You can’t accidentally pour too much detergent into your machine with a pod. But you can’t pretreat or precisely adjust your dose per load, and they are typically more expensive, which is why we generally prefer liquid and powder formulas. Responsible storage of pods (and all detergents) is also an important consideration in order to help prevent accidental ingestion and poisoning, particularly for those living in households with children or people living with dementia.\nSheet detergents are relatively new. While they are sometimes advertised as a so-called plastic-free alternative to laundry detergent pods, they use the same petroleum-based PVA/PVOH that encases pods. Few detergent sheets contain enzymes; four of the five brands we tested do not. The sheets we tested were all terrible cleaners, and they don’t offer any advantage—environmental or convenient—over pods.\nWe tested more than 35 laundry detergents. You can read our full testing protocol.\nHere’s how we evaluated them:\nFormulas and ingredients: For this guide we looked at high-efficiency (HE), enzymatic (sometimes called bio-based) detergents. (We also tested a few detergents that do not contain enzymes.) We paid close attention to ingredients lists and made note of possible irritants, including fragrances, dyes, and a few specific preservatives that some people may be sensitive to.\nStain removal: We looked for detergents that clean a wide variety of stains effectively. Using a detergent that eradicates stains means you may not have to pretreat mild-to-medium stains or pretreat and rewash heavy stains, ultimately saving time and energy (and, hopefully, your favorite shirt).\nCold water performance: The majority of energy used by a washing machine occurs during hot water cycles. Washing clothes in cold water saves energy and is ultimately one of the most environmentally impactful things you can do in the laundry room. (Research also suggests that using cold water might reduce microfiber and microplastic waste from your clothes, though the science is not settled.) We tested every detergent using cold water, evaluating how each dissolved and checking the washer drum and dispenser for residue. All of our picks remove stains and odors in cold water well and leave no residue.\nOdor removal: We washed T-shirts stained with bacon grease with each detergent and had volunteers smell and rank them after they dried.\nScent: Whether or not you want a scented detergent comes down to personal preference. In general, we favored unscented or mildly scented options.\nAvailability: While we tested a few more niche laundry detergents, we looked for detergents with widespread availability.\nThere’s no industry-wide stain standard for detergent testing, but we took cues from the guidelines established by ASTM International, a global standards development organization, for making stains and evaluating them. We test each detergent using specialized test strips (stained with more than a dozen substances, including red wine, pig blood, sebum, peat, and engine oil). We also stain T-shirts with two sets of identical stains, including grass, coffee, tea, and motor oil (which helps test odor removal). We wash the strips and T-shirts with a full load of laundry in a cold water wash, eliminating low-performing detergents after each round.\nAdvertisement\nThis powerful powder dissolves swiftly and completely, eliminates many tough stains, and leaves a light scent. But it’s less effective on greasy stains than our liquid picks.\nTide Ultra Oxi Powder Laundry Detergent outperformed all the other powder detergents we tested, removing some of the toughest stains and odors with ease. This detergent contains clean-boosting oxygen bleach, and its residue-free formula dissolves quickly, even in cold water. It fell slightly short when tackling greasy stains, though.\nIt’s an excellent cleaner. Tide Ultra Oxi Powder cleaned everyday stains, such as sebum, as well as any other detergent, but it truly excelled at removing challenging stains. It almost entirely eliminated a turmeric-infused aioli stain (with and without pretreating) that was nearly impossible for every other detergent to remove. This detergent also easily eradicated tannin stains (wine, tea, coffee), dirt, grass, and other highly pigmented natural stains, such as blackberry.\nTide Ultra Oxi Powder’s strong cleaning power is partly due to its inclusion of sodium percarbonate (a solid form of hydrogen peroxide that is also known as oxygen bleach, the main ingredient in OxiClean).\nBut it doesn’t clean greasy stains as well as our liquid picks. If you tend to find a lot of grease or food stains, you may want to consider one of our liquid detergent picks. Though this detergent still performed above average on oil-based stains, a liquid detergent will better penetrate oil-based stains during pretreating and the wash itself.\nIt dissolves exceptionally well, even in cold water. Tide Ultra Oxi Powder left no residue in the detergent dispensers of the washing machines we used in testing. In one of our solubility tests, it expanded immediately in a cup of water and left very little residue after being poured out. (The worst performing powder detergents left hard bricks of sediment that did not rinse out.) Tide Ultra Oxi Powder also clumped less in the box than other powder detergents, and any settling was easy to break apart.\nIt’s easy to pretreat with. Pretreating with Tide Ultra Oxi Powder wasn’t any messier than pretreating with a liquid detergent. Its fast-dissolving granules easily produced a paste for pretreating stains, which is rarely the case when using a powder detergent. (For the neatest application, either wet the stain and treat with powder detergent or premix a paste by slowly adding a small amount of water to a tablespoon of detergent until you reach the desired consistency.)\nIt’s conveniently packaged (for a powder). Tide Ultra Oxi Powder comes in a large cardboard box with a perforated zip opening that was among the easiest to open and store long term. (Some of the boxed powder detergents we tested were comically challenging to open.) After opening, the top of the box can be folded down again to close the detergent, preventing the powder granules from being exposed to air, which can cause clumping.\nBut you may want to test for colorfastness before using it on especially saturated colors. We had no issues with colorfastness in testing, but we came across one customer who claimed their clothing was bleached by this detergent. As with any detergent, use caution if you are washing newer, dyed clothing. Washing in cold water should limit excessive fading, but when in doubt, test for colorfastness.\nPrice per load: 26¢ (73 loads in a 127-ounce package)\nThis fragrance- and dye-free liquid was the most well-rounded liquid detergent we tested, tackling a variety of stains and odors well.\nTide Free & Gentle Liquid Laundry Detergent was the most well-rounded option we tested, successfully tackling a wide variety of stains and odors in our testing. This detergent doesn’t contain dyes or fragrances and may appeal to those with allergies or other sensitivities.\nIt’s an excellent cleaner. In testing, Tide Free & Gentle liquid detergent easily handled sebum, as well as some of the toughest stains thrown its way, including blackberry, mayonnaise, butter, chocolate, wine, and pig blood. In fact, of the many detergents we tested, it was one of the best at removing blood, even after the stain sat overnight.\nOn our standard stain strip tests, Tide Free & Gentle liquid detergent was a top performer. It also eliminated stains from natural pigments, such as turmeric, better than our runner-up pick, though it did not handle them as well as our favorite powder detergent did.\nNotably, Tide Free & Gentle was among the liquid detergents that did the best job at eliminating grass stains—a notoriously tough stain for many detergents to entirely wipe out.\nIt eliminates odors well. It thoroughly removed odor, even from pet messes. Arguably more impressive: In our more casual home-testing, it washed out funky teenage smells in one cycle.\nIt’s free of dyes and fragrances. Tide Free & Gentle liquid detergent (along with its pod counterpart) is formulated without common irritants; it’s free of dyes, fragrances, and the preservative MI/MIL. It is also a certified EPA Safer Choice product and carries seals from the National Psoriasis Foundation and the National Eczema Association.\nPrice per load: 20¢ (80 loads in a 115-ounce bottle)\nAdvertisement\nThis liquid detergent was among the top performers in stain removal, but its strong scent lingers long after clothes have dried.\nWith store pickup or Walmart+ (150 ounces)\nPersil Original Liquid Detergent Everyday Clean came in a very close second overall to Tide Free & Gentle liquid detergent in our stain testing—so close that most people won’t notice an obvious difference. Its strong scent, however, is polarizing.\nIt cleans about as well as our top liquid pick. Persil Original Liquid Detergent Everyday Clean performed consistently well in our stain strip tests, removing more cocoa stains than any other detergent we tested, including our other picks. In our stain monitor test, it did the best on a chocolate-based stain and an animal fat and dye stain, but it fell short on peat, butter, and wine. It did not pretreat well.\nBut it has a very strong scent. Persil Original Liquid Detergent Everyday Clean has a powerful, lingering scent that isn’t for everyone. It was so overpowering that in our odor-removal tests, we found it tricky to distinguish between true odor elimination and the fragrance. If you are sensitive to fragrance or just plain picky about scents, this detergent might not be for you. (Persil detergent is available in an unscented formula, which performed just a hair below the original in our testing.)\nIt has a particularly concentrated formula. Persil Original Liquid Detergent Everyday Clean is twice concentrated, so it requires smaller doses of detergent per load than our other liquid picks. The concentrated formula also means the bottle is lighter and more compact.\nIt has an especially useful measuring cap. We preferred this cap to those of other liquid detergents because it is smaller than most and easy to dose with. Its compact size and shape—less flimsy than many we’ve seen—seem to make it less likely to break, too.\nIt isn’t as readily available as our other picks. Persil detergents are made by Henkel, a German company. Persil has been used in Europe for more than a century, but it was only introduced to the US in 2015 and may be harder to find.\nPrice per load: 22¢ (110 loads in a 82.5-ounce bottle)\nLaundry pods, with a single dose of detergent that you pop in the machine, are convenient to carry and easy to use. But you sacrifice some cleaning power with pods, you can’t pretreat stains with them, and you might be concerned about their safety and the environmental impact of their PVA/PVOH coatings. Of all the pod detergents we tested, we recommend Tide Pods Free & Gentle Laundry Detergent. \nThey are good cleaners, but not as well rounded as our picks. These pods did a good job overall of removing or lessening a variety of stains, though not quite as well as our powder and liquid picks. The pods primarily fell short in removing the most challenging stains, especially a combination of animal fat and dye and used engine oil.\nThe liquid cleaning agents in Tide Free & Gentle pods—concentrated detergent, color protectors, and stain-removal boosters—are kept in separate chambers.\nThey’re more versatile than most pods. Tide Free & Gentle pods are slightly smaller than other pods we tested, making it easier to adjust your dose up and down accordingly. (Tide recommends using one pod for medium loads, two pods for large loads, and three pods for extra-large loads, but based on our testing, one pod works for most loads.)\n But you can’t use them to pretreat stains. You cannot pretreat stains with these (or any) pods, nor can you precisely measure the amount of detergent you want in the same way you can with liquids or powders.\nThey are scent free. We liked these pods because they are scent free, and many of the pods we tested had strong scents.\nThe packaging is secure. Responsible storage of pods (and all detergents) is important to help prevent accidental ingestion and poisoning, particularly for those living in households with children or people living with dementia. These pods come in a childproof package and contain a bittering agent that would cause someone to spit it out quickly if unintentionally ingested.\nPrice per load: 34¢ (for an 81-count package)\nAdvertisement\nIf you’d prefer an effective liquid detergent that is free of potentially irritating ingredients and isn’t packaged in plastic, Dirty Labs Bio Enzyme Liquid Detergent Free & Clear is a good option. We tested 17 detergents that purport to be more sustainable, and this Dirty Labs detergent removed stains and odors the best—even rivaling larger name brands.\nIt’s a strong cleaner, though not quite as effective as our top picks. Dirty Labs Free & Clear detergent did well on our stain strip and stain monitor tests, even knocking out turmeric stains slightly better than some of our highest-performing liquid detergents (our picks included). It removed the chocolate-based stain better than our powder pick, though it struggled a bit with tannin stains (tea, coffee) and some blood stains.\nIt’s free of some common irritants and preservatives. Dirty Labs Free & Clear detergent is a promising option for those with sensitive skin and who want to use a detergent other than Tide; it doesn’t contain sulfates, synthetic preservatives (such as methylisothiazolinone), or optical brighteners. It is the only one of our picks that has been verified by the EWG. (Of the EWG-verified detergents we tested, it performed the best.)\nIt’s fragrance free, but available in scented versions. We recommend the scentless Free & Clear version, but it’s also available in two not-unpleasant scents: Signature (magnolia, bergamot, cedar) and Murasaki (jasmine, matcha, vetiver).\nIts packaging is lightweight and recyclable, and its measuring cap is convenient. This detergent comes in a recyclable aluminum bottle. The starter set includes a silicone beaker for pouring; you can throw the beaker into the washing machine to clean it along with your laundry, ensuring you don’t waste a drop of detergent. We appreciated this nifty way to stay neat, though we’ve found customer reviews complaining that the beaker is a pain to use.\nPrice per load: 47¢ (32 loads in an 8.6-ounce starter bottle); 33¢ (80 loads in a 21.6-ounce refill bottle)\nIf you’d prefer a different liquid, pod, or powder formula of Tide than our picks: We tested 17 versions of Tide (liquids, powders, and pods). Tide Original Scent, Tide Ultra Stain Release (a former pick, but hard to find), Tide Ultra Oxi, and Tide Hygienic Clean Heavy Duty 10X liquid detergents all clean very well.\nThese same detergents in pod form, especially the Tide Hygienic Clean Heavy Duty 10X Power Pods, were also strong performers but are larger than the pods we recommend and don’t give as much flexibility when it comes to dosing.\nOn the powder front, Tide Original Powder Laundry Detergent is a solid option; it removes stains and leaves clothing feeling soft and smelling fresh. (It features the same quick-dissolve technology that our powder pick does.) And though we liked Tide Free & Gentle Powder Laundry Detergent, Procter & Gamble recently discontinued it. If you’re able to find it before it fully disappears, it’s worth trying.\nIf you’d like a high-performing powder detergent and don’t mind fragrance: Gain laundry detergent might fit the bill. It is strongly scented, and we have noticed people either love it or hate it. Gain Original Powder Laundry Detergent handled stains about as well as our second place powder detergent, Tide Original. It also features the same Clean Dissolve technology as our pick, dissolving easily, quickly, and completely in cold water.\nIf you’d like a capable liquid detergent for a budget price: We recommend Kirkland Signature Ultra Clean HE Liquid Laundry Detergent, Costco’s house-brand detergent and our former budget pick. (Its price per load is around 12¢ for a 146-load, 194-ounce bottle.) This detergent cleaned nearly as well overall as our liquid picks, and it rose to the occasion in our pretreatment tests, eliminating a variety of stains (especially foundation and lipstick) nearly as well as our top performers. Its large container is a pain to carry, but is designed to stay in one place and dispense detergent like a water cooler. If you do your laundry at a laundromat, you may want to consider an easier-to-tote option.\nIf you are looking for a dye- and fragrance-free powder detergent that cleans well: Your best bet is Biokleen Laundry Powder Free & Clear. Of the powders we tested, it performed above average for stain removal and eliminated odors pretty well. But it left some residue and sediment behind in our solubility tests, and its box is cumbersome.\nIf you want a single-dose powder detergent: Seventh Generation Laundry Detergent Packs Free & Clear are filled with dye- and fragrance-free powder detergent and performed very well in our tests. They are encased in the same PVA/PVOH film that most liquid pods are.\nAdvertisement\nWe had high hopes for 9 Elements, a detergent made by Procter & Gamble that claims to be “made with 9 or fewer” ingredients, including vinegar. It was not a good stain remover, and the scent was too artificial.\nAll Stainlifter is a budget detergent that performed worse than water on three stains in our testing. (All is made by Henkel, the same company that makes Persil.)\nArm & Hammer Plus OxiClean was one of the weakest detergents we tested and did not remove odor well.\nClean Cult detergents smell good, but they ranked far lower for stain removal than the other liquid detergents we tested that claim to be more sustainable.\nWe ordered detergent from DedCool and Maison Francis Kurkdjian Paris, both of which are focused on fragrance. But after smelling their strong scents—and noting their very high prices—we decided against testing them for now.\nDreft Free & Gentle Unscented liquid detergent is marketed as being formulated for an entire household’s laundry needs, including washing baby clothing. While a baby-specific detergent isn’t necessary, Dreft’s gentle, unscented formula removed many stains well but primarily fell short on more industrial stains like used engine oil.\nGain liquid detergent was a less powerful stain remover than similar liquid detergents, such as Tide Original Scent liquid detergent.\nThe plant-based Method laundry detergent barely made a dent in many stains, and we had similarly disappointing results from Mrs. Meyer’s. Method detergent contains sodium laureth sulfate (which can lead to higher 1,4 dioxane levels) and the preservative methylisothiazolinone (MI). Mrs. Meyer’s is SLS free, but also contains MI.\nSwash, a laundry detergent developed in-house at Maytag, was one of the worst detergents we tested. Even stranger, it didn’t perform better in a Maytag machine.\nTide Purclean filled our washing machine with a comical amount of suds (though those suds did wipe stubborn stains away). According to customer reviews, this seems to be a relatively common issue.\nTide Simply Clean & Fresh, a budget detergent that doesn’t contain enzymes, was one of the worst performers in our stain-removal tests, somehow doing a poorer job than plain water did on cocoa.\nBioklean Laundry Liquid Free & Clear was an average cleaner. If you want a dye- and fragrance-free liquid, better options are available.\nDefunkify Free and Clear Liquid Laundry Detergent, which is EWG verified and popular on Amazon, was one of the weaker liquid detergents we tested.\nEcos liquid detergent had an average score, losing points on some easier stains to clean, such as tomato sauce.\nSeventh Generation Free & Clear detergent removed stains pretty well except for sebum, which is arguably the most important stain to be removed.\nArm & Hammer powder detergent did decently in testing but did not remove stains as well as other widely available powders.\nDefunkify Powder Laundry Detergent was nearly as good at removing stains as our picks, though it lost some points for its flimsy plastic bag and less-dissolvable formula.\nMolly’s Suds Original Laundry Detergent Powder was by far the worst detergent of all types that we tested, barely eliminating any stains, even with pretreating.\nThe stain-removing power of the compressed powder in Blueland Laundry Detergent Tablets is decent. But the tablets, which come in a reusable tin, broke apart very easily (several arrived broken). If you are really into the idea of recyclable and reusable packaging, cheaper and better options are available, like our also-great pick.\nThe box of Dropps we ordered arrived damaged and wet because half the pods had burst. Our attempts to rectify this with customer service were unsuccessful, so we decided not to test it further.\nGain Flings Ultra Oxi Detergent Pacs did not remove stains as well as any of the Tide pods we tested.\nLaundry Sauce touts its Laundry Detergent Pods as “the world’s best smelling laundry detergent,” but they are extremely expensive, and we chose not to test them this round after smelling their strong scent.\nPersil Oxi Discs removed stains well, but they were too strongly scented.\nTide Simply Pods contain no enzymes in its formula and barely removed stains in initial testing.\nClean People, Earth Breeze, Spot, Ecos, and Tru Earth are all sheet detergents that did among the worst in our detergent testing.\nLaundry detergent ingredients aren’t usually printed on the detergent bottle, but you should be able to find them listed on the company’s website. (For Tide and Persil detergents, as well as some others, look for a link to the SmartLabel, which lists the ingredients and describes what they’re used for.)\nMost laundry detergent contains a similar combination of chemical agents and ingredients.\nOne of the most important of these is surface active agents, or surfactants. These molecules work like soap, pulling soils off surfaces and making them easy to wash away (and, unlike soap, they don’t make soap scum).\nEnzymes also play a pivotal role. These large biological molecules are secreted by living organisms and speed up chemical reactions. The enzymes used in laundry detergent are chosen based on their ability to break down specific stain-causing substances, making it easier for them to be washed away. Different enzymes target different kinds of molecules, and thus combat different stains (lipase, for example, is an enzyme found in digestive systems that breaks down fats specifically and is often used in detergent to attack grease stains). This is why you will often see a combination of multiple enzymes (protease, lipase, amylase, and so on) in laundry detergent.\nOxidizing agents, like sodium percarbonate and hydrogen peroxide, are bleach alternatives. (Bleach deactivates enzymes and is also harsher on fabric.) They break up certain stain molecules, including more pigmented stains like tannins or turmeric, until they are no longer visible to the human eye.\nThe minerals in hard water can alter the efficacy of a detergent. Many detergents have added water softeners to ensure they work in hard water.\nPolymers, aka strings of molecules that are made up of a smaller repeating unit, are common dispersing agents—they suspend the dirt and grime lifted from your clothes to prevent them from redepositing to your clothing during the wash.\nOptical brighteners are compounds that stick to the surface of your clothes and cause people to perceive clothes as whiter. Some people are concerned about optical brighteners and their potential toxicity.\nFinally, many detergents contain a suds suppressor, also known as an antifoam agent.\nSome people are concerned about ingredients that have a possible impact on human health and the environment. 1,4-dioxane is a potentially carcinogenic contaminant, not an ingredient, often found in small amounts in laundry detergent. Sometimes compared to forever chemicals, it has been found in water systems throughout the US. Legislation was recently passed in New York to limit how much 1,4-dioxane is in household products, though the vast majority of 1,4-dioxane is from industrial waste, not household use.\nPhthalates are plasticizers, which soften up hard plastics and make them harder to break. In laundry detergent, they are used to deliver long-lasting fragrance. They are in a lot of products, but how exactly they affect our health is not clear. Some tests using lab animals show that they can harm reproductive systems, and some evidence shows that the compounds have been linked to human infertility. The FDA has said that phthalates in detergents don’t presently pose a risk to our health, but the situation is being monitored. If you’re concerned, choose a fragrance-free detergent.\nAdvertisement\nPeople sometimes suspect an allergy to their laundry detergent after noticing otherwise inexplicable hives or contact dermatitis. This makes sense; many potentially irritating ingredients are in laundry detergent: fragrance, dyes, surfactants (such as sodium laureth sulfate), or preservatives.\nThe most common irritant found in laundry detergent is methylisothiazolinone (MI), sometimes used along with methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI). These preservatives prevent the growth of mold and bacteria; they are also widely known as skin irritants. All our picks are free of MI/MCI.\nWhile MI and MCI are well known to be irritating to human skin, the general consensus (PDF) in the medical community is that a true allergic reaction caused by laundry detergent residue is possible, but very unlikely. This is due to the almost undetectable concentrations of irritants on textiles after being washed. Fabric dyes, textile treatments, sweat dermatitis, or even rubberized clothing could all be the culprit. Other skin conditions, like psoriasis, may also be confused with an allergy. Body creams, shower gels, shampoos, and other regularly used cosmetics frequently contain MI and MCI and are directly applied to skin, a more likely cause of contact dermatitis than detergent, too.\nThough a laundry detergent allergy is rare and somewhat controversial in the medical community, it is still hypothetically possible. If you’ve ruled out all other causes, you don’t have to throw out a full bottle or box of detergent just yet. Board-certified dermatologist Emily Milam suggests you try using less detergent, first. If it’s possible on your washing machine, you can also try adding an extra rinse cycle to ensure all detergent residue is washed away. If that doesn’t solve the issue, consider a detergent that is free of MI/MCI, dyes, and fragrance.\nHigh-efficiency (HE) washing machines (which include all front-loading machines and some top-loading washers) use significantly less water than standard washing machines, according to the American Cleaning Institute’s HE Washers and Detergents guide (PDF). Instead of submerging clothing in a tub of water, washing machines wet clothing at the beginning of a cycle and keep them saturated throughout the wash.\nBecause HE washers use less water, you need a special detergent to use in them. The detergents are designed to foam less so your machine doesn’t fill with suds. HE detergents also have ingredients that keep dirt and grime suspended in water and prevents them from being redistributed to your clothing.\nAdvertisement\nTerms like nontoxic, eco-friendly, green, or natural can be confusing. In the laundry industry these terms are often related more to marketing than formulations. These terms don’t have an agreed upon definition in the industry, explained Jennifer Ahoni, the director of fabric care communications at Procter & Gamble.\nDetergents labeled as eco-friendly tend to use more plant-derived, rather than petroleum-derived, ingredients. And they may avoid some ingredients of concern, like optical brighteners and phthalates (though we’ve seen known irritants on the labels of plenty of so-called natural detergents).\nIf you are dedicated to buying more sustainable detergent or you want to avoid potentially harmful ingredients, you can look for some independent certifications on a label.\nTo find detergents that contain less environmentally harmful ingredients, consider ones certified by the EPA’s Safer Choice program. Products with the Safer Choice label must meet specific human- and environmental-safety criteria—the EPA examines a product’s entire formulation for things that may be acutely or chronically toxic. Unlike the USDA BioPreferred Program, the Safer Choice program factors in performance as well as chemical ingredients, packaging, ingredient disclosures, and volatile organic compounds.\nEWG’s Guide to Healthy Cleaning is an organization that advocates for transparency and accountability in the health and environmental impacts of product formulations.\nEWG Verified cleaning products are verified and tested by a non-EWG third party. (Our also-great pick, Dirty Labs Bio Enzyme Laundry Detergent Free & Clear, has EWG verification and the EPA’s Safer Choice label.)\nTo ensure the detergent you’re using wasn’t tested on animals, you can look for the Leaping Bunny certification, which indicates animal testing was not used at any stage in development of the product or formulation.\nThe American Cleaning Institute offers simple actions you can take at home to do laundry more sustainably. These include washing your clothing in cold water, using up all of your detergent to eliminate waste, and considering hang-drying your clothes (dryers use a lot of energy).\nNo. For baby items and cloth diapers, don’t bother with a baby-specific laundry detergent. They are expensive and unnecessary.\nFor cloth diapers, avoid products that will leave unnecessary residue, such as fabric softener. Use a detergent that is free of optical brighteners and fragrance, two ingredients designed to linger on fabric that could potentially interfere with a diaper’s absorbency and lead to leaks. (One of our also-great picks, Dirty Labs Bio Enzyme Free & Clear Laundry Detergent, does not contain these ingredients and would be a good choice for cloth diapers.)\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, many parents wash their babies’ clothes with the rest of the family’s laundry without encountering any problems. A detergent for sensitive skin would be in order only if your baby develops an allergy.\nAdvertisement\nEvery detergent expert we talked to advises against homemade detergent because of how much science and expertise goes into an effective cleaner. DIY formulas usually have only three ingredients—some kind of soap, washing soda, and borax. (We’ve made DIY dishwasher detergent that includes washing soda, and its fine granules had us sneezing up a storm.)\nDIY detergents don’t have enzymes or surfactants to fight stains, and their simpler formulas can also damage your clothes. Without the added water softeners found in typical laundry detergents, the soap can react with minerals in hard water to leave behind soap scum. And with soft water, it’s easy to use too much soap; this can also result in residue left on clothes, fading colors, and increasing the wear on fabric. Soap scum can cause problems in washing machines, too, leading to bacteria and mold growth, which can then get on your clothing.\nSarah Bogdan and Leigh Krietsch Boerner wrote previous versions of this guide, which was first published in 2013. \nThis article was edited by Ingrid Skjong and Courtney Schley.\nSammy Wang and Jennifer Ahoni, fabric care team at Procter & Gamble, video interview, September 28, 2023\nTre Wright, chemical engineer, phone interview, December 14, 2023\nDaniel Conrad, global engineering director of design quality, reliability, and testing, Hussmann, video interview, June 23, 2023\nPete He, co-founder and chief scientist, and Soyoung Park, CMO, Dirty Labs, video interview, October 11, 2023\nEmily C.

Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nStudy after study shows the benefits of drinking tea, essentially verifying what your ancestors believed back in ancient times. The humble tea plant — a shrub known as Camellia sinensis — has long supplied an answer to ailments.\nBut what tea is best? There isn’t just one option, after all. Just look at your local grocery store. Dozens upon dozens of options sit on the shelf waiting to be tossed into your cart. It can be a little overwhelming.\nTo make sense of it, we turn to dietitian Beth Czerwony, RD. “Different teas offer different benefits,” she says. “Choose what fits your need.”\nRead on to find which will suit you to a… well, T.\nWhen it comes to tea, green tea gets the gold. “Green tea is the champ when it comes to offering health benefits,” says Czerwony. “It’s the Swiss Army knife of teas. It covers a lot of territory.”\nA medical literature review offers a snapshot of those benefits, linking the consumption of green tea to:\nThe healing power of green tea is linked to catechin, an antioxidant compound found in tea leaves. It helps protect your cells from damage caused by out-of-hand free radicals reacting with other molecules in your body.\nAdvertisement\nAll that, plus green tea tastes pretty darn good, too. (That could also explain why worldwide green tea production is expected to hit nearly 3 million tons by 2023.)\nIs your stomach feeling a bit topsy-turvy, like you just wobbled off a swooping and looping rollercoaster? The solution is a tea made from ginger, a time-tested spice that has been calming bellies since ancient times.\nStudies show that ginger naturally combats nausea, making it a go-to remedy if you’re dealing with morning sickness during pregnancy, notes Czerwony.\nGinger also offers proven digestive benefits by helping your body move food from your stomach to continue its digestive tract journey. Speeding up that process works to calm indigestion and ease stomach distress.\n“Ginger relaxes things in your gut, which can make you a lot more comfortable if you’re having tummy trouble,” Czerwony said.\nIf ginger isn’t to your liking, peppermint tea also can serve as an aid against indigestion. Peppermint, however, is best for issues lower in your gut. It can actually aggravate higher-up issues such as acid reflux.\nIf you’re worried about your lungs, here’s how to breathe easier: Drink herbal tea.\nAnti-inflammatory powers in herbal teas can help loosen airways tightened by conditions such as asthma, says Czerwony. She recommends herbal teas featuring turmeric, cinnamon or ginger as a way to keep the air flowing.\nAs an added benefit, drinking a hot cup of herbal tea can also help clear congestion by loosening mucus. “It’ll clean out the gunk,” says Czerwony.\nMenthol packs quite the punch when it comes to fighting a cold — and peppermint tea is packed with menthol. “It really kicks up your immune system,” says Czerwony.\nPeppermint tea works well to relax sore throat muscles, relieve nasal congestion and even reduce a fever. It’s also loaded with antibacterial and antiviral properties to give you a healthy boost.\nOther teas to try when you’re not feeling 100% include:\nIf you’re looking to catch some ZZZs, brew a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime.\nThe reason? The daisy-like chamomile plant contains apigenin, an antioxidant compound and snooze inducer. Apigenin attaches itself to receptors in your brain and works to reduce anxiety, building a peaceful calm that leads to drowsiness.\n“Chamomile basically acts as a mild tranquilizer,” says Czerwony. “Those sips really will help you sleep.”\nValerian root tea also is a good option if you’re tired of counting sheep to get some shut-eye.\nBlack tea offers many of the same benefits as green tea, which makes sense when you consider they’re made from the same plant leaves.\nAdvertisement\nSo why are they different?

Drinking certain tea varieties has been linked to several health advantages, including improved heart health, enhanced immune system function, and reduced risk of chronic diseases, depending on the tea. Interestingly, some teas are noted for offering more pronounced health benefits than others, attributed to their high levels of antioxidants, polyphenols, and other beneficial compounds.\n\nStefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography / Getty Images\n There are two categories of tea: \""true tea,\"" which originates from the Camellia sinensis plant, and herbal teas, which are concoctions of various plants, herbs, fruits, or spices infused in hot water. True teas contain caffeine, as well as antioxidants known as catechins. Herbal teas—such as chamomile, peppermint, or hibiscus—are caffeine-free teas and offer a myriad of health benefits like soothing an upset stomach, reducing inflammation, and promoting relaxation.\n\n Most teas offer comfort in a cup and health benefits to boot, but some might be more beneficial for your health than others. If you are looking for the “best” teas for your health, here are the top 10.\n\nFrank Rothe / Getty Images\n Green tea stands out as one of the healthiest choices among various types of teas, primarily due to its high concentration of antioxidants. Green tea comes from the Camellia sinensis plant.\n\n Just like other true teas, green tea is unique in its preparation. The leaves are quickly harvested and steamed to prevent oxidation, allowing them to retain their natural green color and potent nutritional profile. This process ensures that green tea is rich in catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a powerful antioxidant known for its myriad health benefits.\n\n These benefits include aiding in weight loss, supporting brain function, and heart health benefits. Green tea is also associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancers and has anti-inflammatory properties, making it a superior choice for those looking to enhance their overall health.\n\nKilito Chan / Getty Images\n Black tea, distinguished by its rich flavor and dark coloration, is another excellent choice. Characterized as a fully oxidized tea, it undergoes a longer fermentation process than green tea, which contributes to its distinctively robust flavor and higher caffeine content.\n\n Originating from the same Camellia sinensis plant, the difference in black tea's health benefits and profile is primarily due to its unique processing method. This procedure enhances its concentration of flavonoids, particularly theaflavins and thearubigins, which are potent antioxidants known to support heart health by potentially helping reduce cholesterol levels, improving gut health, and decreasing blood pressure.\n\n Black tea has also been linked to reduced stroke risk and a lower likelihood of developing dementia, making it one of the healthiest tea choices for those aiming to bolster their overall wellness.\n\nNATALIA KHIMICH / Getty Images\n Peppermint tea is a popular herbal tea made from the leaves of the peppermint plant, known scientifically as Mentha piperita. It's not only cherished for its refreshing taste but also for its wide range of health benefits.\n\n Rich in antioxidants, peppermint tea aids in supporting digestion in certain situations. Its antispasmodic properties also help in relieving muscle spasms and stomach discomfort. It's naturally caffeine-free, making it an excellent choice for those looking to reduce their caffeine intake while still enjoying a soothing, flavorful beverage.\n\n Peppermint tea may offer unique benefits for people focused on lowering their testosterone levels, like some people with a diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Some data suggest that drinking peppermint tea may help people experience lower testosterone, but more quality data is needed to confirm this.\n\nTetra Images / Getty Images\n Chamomile tea, derived from the dried flowers of the chamomile plant, is a widely consumed herbal tea known for its calming effects. It's a healthy choice for several reasons. Firstly, chamomile tea is imbued with antioxidants, which play a role in reducing the risk of several diseases, including heart disease and cancer.\n\n Chamomile is also known for its potential to promote better sleep quality due to its apigenin content, an antioxidant that binds to certain receptors in the brain to decrease anxiety and initiate sleep. Additionally, chamomile tea has properties that may aid in digestion and reduce the severity of menstrual pain. Its gentle, soothing qualities make it an excellent beverage for relaxation and stress reduction.\n\nGuidoVrola / Getty Images\n Oolong tea, a traditional Chinese tea that falls somewhere between green and black tea in oxidation, presents a myriad of health benefits, making it a great choice for tea enthusiasts. Its unique processing involves withering the plant under the strong sun and then oxidation before curling and twisting.\n\n This particular method retains antioxidant properties and mineral content, which are beneficial for reducing inflammation, supporting healthy metabolism, and supporting heart health.\n\nStefan Tomic / Getty Images\n Dandelion tea, derived from the roots and leaves of the dandelion plant, stands out as a healthful beverage choice due to its plethora of benefits. It is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which contribute to potentially helping support liver health, stimulating digestion, and reducing inflammation in the body.\n\n Dandelion tea also has diuretic properties that help flush out toxins, promoting kidney health. The presence of potent antioxidants, further enhances its ability to combat oxidative stress, supporting overall wellness.\n\nStefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography / Getty Images\n White tea, named for the fine white fuzz that covers its buds, is a minimally processed tea known for its delicate flavor and aroma. This tea originates primarily from the Camellia sinensis plant's young leaves and buds. A standout feature of white tea is its high antioxidant content. These compounds can help combat oxidative stress and may support overall health by reducing the risk of chronic diseases.\n\n White tea's low caffeine content makes it a gentle, calming beverage choice for many, offering a subtle energy boost without the jitters associated with stronger caffeinated drinks. Additionally, white tea is revered for its potential benefits, including supporting heart health, aiding in weight management, and enhancing skin health.\n\nLiudmila Chernetska / Getty Images\n Rooibos tea, originating from the South African fynbos region, is a caffeine-free herbal tea made from the leaves of the Aspalathus linearis plant. This reddish-brown tea is celebrated for its sweet, earthy flavor and a variety of health benefits. Rooibos is rich in antioxidants, which help combat free radicals in the body, potentially reducing the risk of cancer and heart disease. It's also known for its calming properties, assisting in reducing stress and promoting restful sleep.\n\nmescioglu / Getty Images\n Hibiscus tea, a refreshing beverage made from the dried petals of the Hibiscus sabdariffa flower, is known for its tangy flavor, and its health benefits. Containing antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene, it aids in neutralizing free radicals that can cause inflammation and disease.\n\n Hibiscus tea may contribute to lowering blood pressure and improving overall cardiovascular health, making it a healthy choice for those looking to enhance their diet with beneficial plant compounds.\n\n5second / Getty Images\n Ginger tea, known for its distinctive spicy flavor and aroma, is a popular herbal beverage made from the root of the ginger plant. It is hailed as a healthy choice due to its rich content of antioxidants and bioactive compounds, such as gingerol, which have potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. These properties contribute to numerous health benefits, including easing digestive discomfort, reducing nausea, and potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases.\n\n Preparing tea is both an art and a science. Begin by boiling water, but be mindful not to overheat—different teas flourish at varying temperatures. For most teas, steeping for 3 to 5 minutes extracts the perfect balance of flavor. Consider adding functional ingredients like ginger for digestion, honey for sweetness, or lemon for a vitamin C boost.\n\n Choosing between loose-leaf tea and tea bags can significantly affect the quality of your tea experience. Loose-leaf teas may offer a superior flavor and aroma, as they contain larger leaves that have room to expand and fully release their essence during steeping. On the other hand, tea bags provide convenience and speed, perfect for those on the go. \n\n Oversteeping (leaving the tea in hot water too long) may do more harm than good. Doing so can lead to a bitter taste, particularly in black and green teas. Similarly, overheating water can damage delicate tea leaves, especially white and green teas, resulting in a harsh and burnt flavor. \n\n For those who prefer a cooler beverage, transforming your tea into iced tea is simple. Brew it stronger than usual, then pour over ice or chill in the refrigerator to enjoy a refreshing twist on your favorite tea. On sunny days, brewing a sun tea by using the sun’s rays to warm your water while your tea steeps is a fun way to enjoy the season. \n\n The vast world of tea offers an array of flavors, aromas, and health benefits, catering to every preference and need. From the robust, antioxidant-rich green tea, perfect for a morning boost, to the soothing chamomile, ideal for a relaxing evening, each tea brings its unique characteristics to the table. \n\n Regardless of where they rank, each of these ten teas has the potential to add warmth, comfort, and a touch of wellness to your daily routine. Experiment with these varieties to find your perfect cup, and enjoy the simple pleasure and profound benefits that come with it.\n\nChandrasekara A, Shahidi F.

Metabolites. 2022;12(12):1274. doi:10.3390/metabo12121274\nHerbal teas like chamomile, peppermint, and ginger tea offer several health-promoting properties and could help improve heart health, digestion, sleep quality, and more.\nUnlike true teas, which are brewed from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, herbal teas are made from dried fruits, flowers, spices, or herbs (1, 2).\nIn addition to being delicious, some herbal teas have health-promoting properties. In fact, herbal teas have been used as natural remedies for a variety of ailments for hundreds of years.\nHere is a list of 10 healthy herbal teas to try.\nChamomile tea is most commonly known for its calming effects and is frequently used as a sleep aid.\nIn fact, studies show that it could improve sleep quality in older adults and postpartum women (3, 4, 5).\nWhat’s more, chamomile is also believed to have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and liver-protecting effects (6).\nOther research also shows that chamomile could improve blood sugar control and ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (7, 8).\nChamomile may help enhance sleep quality, improve digestive health, stabilize blood sugar levels, and ease symptoms of PMS.\nThough peppermint tea is most popularly used to support digestive health, it also has antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial, and antiviral properties (9).\nSeveral studies have shown that preparations of peppermint oil can help relieve indigestion, nausea, stomach pain, and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (10, 11, 12).\nHowever, keep in mind that it’s unclear whether the amount of peppermint oil found in peppermint tea has the same effect as the concentrated supplements used in these studies. Therefore, more research is needed.\nStudies have found that peppermint oil may help relieve nausea, cramping, and stomach pain.\nGinger tea packs a punch of disease-fighting antioxidants and is a well-known remedy for nausea (13, 14).\nStudies consistently find that ginger is effective at relieving nausea, especially in early pregnancy, although it may also relieve nausea caused by cancer treatments and surgery (15, 16, 17).\nEvidence also suggests that ginger may help prevent stomach ulcers, relieve indigestion, and reduce pain associated with menstruation (18, 19, 20, 21).\nWhat’s more, some studies show that ginger supplements could improve blood sugar control and lipid levels in people with diabetes (22, 23, 24).\nGinger tea may help reduce nausea, relieve period pain, and improve blood sugar and lipid levels in people with diabetes.\nIn addition to its bold color and unique flavor, hibiscus tea offers healthful properties.\nIn fact, though research is mixed, some studies show that hibiscus could significantly reduce total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, along with blood pressure (25, 26, 27, 28).\nWhat’s more, another study found that taking hibiscus tea extract for 6 weeks significantly decreased oxidative stress in male soccer players (29).\nHowever, be sure to talk with a doctor before drinking hibiscus tea if you’re taking diuretics, as it may interact with your medications (30).\nHibiscus tea may help reduce blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels, and decrease oxidative stress.\nEchinacea tea is a popular remedy that’s said to prevent and treat the common cold.\nEvidence has shown that echinacea may help boost the immune system, which could help the body defend against infections (31).\nThough more research is needed, some studies have also found that echinacea can shorten the duration of the common cold or lessen the severity of symptoms (32, 33, 34).\nEchinacea tea is commonly used to shorten the duration of the common cold. However, more research is needed.\nRooibos is an herbal tea that was historically used for medicinal purposes (35).\nThough more research on humans is needed, one study found that rooibos may have anti-allergy effects (36).\nResearch has found that rooibos may inhibit the formation of osteoclasts. These are cells that break down old bones, which is essential for preserving, repairing, and reshaping your skeleton. Inhibiting their formation may help people living with diseases that cause the production of too many osteoclasts, such as osteoporosis (37).\nMoreover, some older studies suggest that rooibos tea could also lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels (38).\nPreliminary evidence suggests that rooibos tea may help improve bone health and reduce heart disease risk, but more studies are needed.\nSage tea is well-known for its medicinal properties and potential benefits for brain health.\nVarious studies on sage have found improvements in the cognitive function of those with Alzheimer’s disease, although the studies had limitations (39).\nA number of studies also found improvements in mental function and memory in healthy adults after they took one of several different types of sage extract (40, 41).\nWhile more research is needed, some studies suggest that sage may also help lower levels of total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels (42, 43, 44).\nSeveral studies have found that sage improves cognitive function, memory, and heart health.\nLemon balm tea has a light, lemony flavor and seems to have health-promoting properties. \nIn one small study, drinking lemon balm tea for 6 weeks improved arterial stiffness, which is a risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and mental decline (45, 46).\nResearch has also found that drinking lemon balm may increase the body’s natural antioxidant enzymes, which help protect the body from oxidative damage (47). \nAdditionally, one review found that lemon balm could even improve symptoms of depression and anxiety, without serious side effects (48).\nPreliminary studies have found that lemon balm tea may help increase antioxidant levels, improve heart health, and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nRose hip tea is high in vitamin C and beneficial plant compounds with anti-inflammatory properties (49).\nSeveral older studies have found that rose hip powder may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms related to rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including pain (50).\nStudies have also found that rose hips may also be beneficial for weight management, helping decrease body mass index (BMI) and belly fat (50).\nStill, more recent human studies are needed to confirm the potential benefits of rose hip tea.\nRose hip tea may reduce inflammation and pain associated with arthritis. It may also support weight management.\nPassionflower tea is traditionally used to relieve anxiety and improve sleep.\nOne study found that taking passionflower extract for 2 weeks improved certain markers of sleep quality in people with insomnia, though there was no significant difference compared with a placebo (51).\nSome other research suggests that passionflower may help relieve symptoms of anxiety, especially during dental procedures (52, 53, 54).\nStudies have found that passionflower tea may improve sleep and anxiety.\nHerbal teas come in a variety of delicious flavors and are naturally free of sugar and calories. \nMany herbal teas also offer health-promoting effects, and modern science has begun to validate some of their traditional uses.\nHowever, keep in mind that more research is needed to understand the effects of drinking herbal tea rather than taking extracts or other supplements.\nShare this article\nCinnamon tea is packed with beneficial compounds that may offer a wide range of health benefits.

Read more about us. \nWith a wide variety of insulated jackets on the market, the classic fleece is still the most comfortable and affordable. These polyester jackets have been providing cozy warmth for years, from campsites and ski resorts to the streets and restaurants of mountain towns. Fleeces run the gamut from casual and cozy to breathable performance pieces for serious adventures. Below are our picks for the best fleece jackets of 2024, with options from leading outdoor brands across a range of price points. For more background, see our fleece jacket comparison table and buying advice below the picks. Of note: This article includes options for both men and women, but we’ve also written a dedicated round-up on the best women’s fleece jackets.\nEditor's note: This round-up was updated on May 3, 2024, to reflect significant updates to the Patagonia R1 TechFace Hoody, share more insight into our testing process, and ensure all product info is up-to-date.\n \nCategory: Performance/casualWeight: 13.8 oz.Fleece weight: Light/midweightWhat we like: Comfortable, highly mobile, breathable, and versatile for both casual and performance use.What we don’t: No chest pocket; slightly technical appearance.\nFor the top all-around fleece on the market, we give the nod to the sleek Kyanite from Arc’teryx. With equal appeal as a midlayer or standalone jacket, the Kyanite is a fantastically versatile piece that places a premium on performance. The Power Stretch Pro fleece is one of our all-time favorites in terms of comfort: It offers an impressive amount of stretch, has a smooth face (great for layering) and brushed liner that’s soft against the skin, and maintains a high-end fit and finish throughout its lifespan. It excels at temperature regulation, too, with enough warmth for spring and fall weather and the ability to effectively dump heat during high-output activity. All told, the Kyanite fits the bill as a premium fleece for everything from daily use to resort skiing, shoulder-season backpacking, and more.\nWhat are the downsides of the Kyanite? While undeniably versatile, we’d recommend looking farther down the list if you have a particular end use in mind—a more sweater-like fleece (like Patagonia’s popular Better Sweater) will be a more suitable match for professional settings, while skiers and climbers might want a more weather-resistant or lightweight option. Pilling has also been an issue with the Kyanite, although you’d be hard-pressed to find a fleece that doesn’t show wear over time. And finally, the jacket doesn’t include a chest pocket, which can be a handy spot to store a phone or other valuables while skiing. But minor nitpicks aside, you won’t find a better quiver-of-one fleece, giving the Kyanite our top billing for 2024. If you prefer a hood, the hoody version of the Kyanite is only $20 more. See the Men's Arc'teryx Kyanite  See the Women's Arc'teryx Kyanite Hoody\n \nCategory: PerformanceWeight: 12.9 oz.Fleece weight: LightweightWhat we like: Combination of warmth and breathability makes this an excellent midlayer for performance use.What we don’t: Fabric loses its loft and softness over time.\nPatagonia’s Regulator (R) collection fleeces are high on performance, from the standard R1 pullover (our favorite climbing midlayer for years) to the TechFace series below. The R1 Air is a relatively recent addition that’s lighter and more breathable than the original, thanks to a new material that uses hollow-fiber yarns and zig-zag patterning to trap heat when you want it and dump it when you don’t. We’ve worn the R1 Air for everything from shoulder-season backpacking to backcountry skiing and winter climbing and have found its combination of warmth and breathability to be superior to most fleeces. And with three streamlined zip pockets, off-shoulder seams for comfort while carrying a pack, and a low-profile hood, it’s fully functional as a standalone piece, too.\nOur biggest gripe with the R1 Air is that its fabric deteriorates over time—it starts out super soft (so cozy that we wore it every day for a month) but packs out and gets slightly abrasive after a bit of wear and washing. What’s more, not everyone will love the look and feel of the raised zig-zags—for comparison, the Kyanite above has a much sleeker exterior that fits the part for standalone use and layers smoothly under a shell. But it’s hard to beat the R1 Air’s lightweight and breathable construction for activities like skiing, climbing, and backpacking, and our hoody has held up decently well over two years of solid use despite the fabric changes. The design has become so popular, in fact, that Patagonia offers the R1 Air in zip-neck and crew versions, too.See the Men's Patagonia R1 Air Hoody  See the Women's Patagonia R1 Air Hoody\n \nCategory: CasualWeight: 12.7 oz.Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: Comfortable, inexpensive, and fun.What we don’t: Sightly inferior build quality and fit.\nLet’s face it: Many people want a fleece as a basic layering piece to stay cozy around the cabin or out by the campfire, and they don’t want to spend $200 to get it. If this sounds like you, the REI Trailmade Fleece is a quality option that truly outperforms its budget-friendly $60 price tag. It’s decently lightweight and relatively easy to squeeze into a pack on a day hike or bike ride, yet built well enough to last through a few seasons of wear. Tack on zippered handwarmer pockets and availability in a large range of sizes (including men’s tall sizes and eight options for women), and there’s a lot to like about this jacket.\nWhat do you sacrifice by going with a fleece like the REI Trailmade? The jacket is built reasonably well, but its recycled polyester is a notable step down in quality compared to more premium options from Patagonia and Arc’teryx. In addition, overall fit and finish fall short, and the feature set is fairly basic (you don't get a chest pocket or thumb loops). But the Trailmade nevertheless is an excellent value and can be worn for everything from outdoor use to travel, which is why it's ranked where it is in our lineup. And we gotta hand it to REI: It’s decently stylish for a budget piece (especially compared to the Columbia below), with fun colorways, thoughtful accent stitching, and contrasting elastic at the cuffs and waist.See the Men's REI Co-op Trailmade  See the Women's REI Co-op Trailmade\n \nCategory: PerformanceWeight: 14.2 oz.Fleece weight: Light/midweightWhat we like: Cozy yet tough and weather-protective with a helmet-compatible hood.What we don’t: Design is on the technical side for daily wear.\nA softshell or synthetic-insulated jacket is a common choice for aerobic activities in cool weather, but performance fleeces are on the rise and some can give those jackets a run for their money. In this category, the Patagonia R1 TechFace Hoody is a phenomenal piece of gear and performs as an excellent outer layer for backcountry skiing, ice climbing, and other winter pursuits. Like most fleeces, the R1 TechFace breathes well, but it goes the extra mile with a tough and weather-resistant face fabric (which is slightly less breathable than other options here) and an adjustable hood with a laminated brim for standalone use in inclement conditions. When a hardshell is too much jacket but you still need some amount of protection, the R1 TechFace is a solid bet.\nPatagonia just updated the TechFace for the first time since 2020, and with that came a substantial $40 price hike. Other changes include a slightly heavier build (by 0.4 oz.) with more recycled components and a PFC-free DWR coating, a larger hood that's now listed as helmet-compatible (we were able to stretch the past version's over a low-profile climbing helmet), and a slightly longer cut. Patagonia also swapped in elastic bindings at the cuffs and moved the interior chest pocket to the outside. Depending on your style, the R1 TechFace might be a bit overkill for casual use—but for the right user, it’s the complete package. It's worth noting there's no longer an identical women's version, although the R1 CrossStrata shares similar intentions and features. And for a bump in warmth, check out the R2 TechFace, which comes in both jacket and hoody versions. We haven't tested the newest version of the R1 TechFace yet but will report back with any findings as soon as we do... Read in-depth review (prior version)See the Patagonia R1 TechFace Hoody\n \nCategory: CasualWeight: 1 lb. 0.9 oz.Fleece weight: HeavyweightWhat we like: Warm and tough.What we don’t: Fit is a little baggy for our taste.\nThe Denali line from The North Face has been on the market for years and is right up there with the Patagonia Synchilla in terms of its iconic status (it’s particularly popular for urban use in cold climates like the East Coast of the United States). The most recent version, which features a slightly thicker fabric than previous models, provides the most warmth and wind protection of any jacket on this list. The fleece is thick and made to last, and the shoulders, hood, and chest feature nylon panels that resist light wind and moisture. For moderate fall and early winter days, the Denali can be your only outer layer.\nKeep in mind that The North Face Denali is one of the heaviest and bulkiest fleeces on this list. Additionally, the jacket lacks any real compression abilities, meaning it is not easily stowed away in a pack. But most people don’t buy the Denali for the backcountry, and it makes a really nice fleece for walking around the city, blocking wind, and providing warmth where others on this list will not. If you’re looking for a substantial and tough fleece jacket from a respected brand, this is it.See the Men's The North Face Denali  See the Women's The North Face Denali\n \nCategory: CasualWeight: 13.2 oz.​Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: Very cozy and warm.What we don’t: No features—this is fleece and nothing more.\nIt’s hard to move very far down this list without including the Synchilla Snap-T. This pullover is pretty much synonymous with the word “fleece,” and despite the simple appearance, it can be a pretty versatile piece of gear. The Synchilla is easy to throw on before heading out for a walk or bike ride, and it's perfect for wearing out on the town after a day of skiing. It’s definitely not performance-oriented in any way, but the masses have had no problem embracing its casual slant.\nDon’t expect a whole lot of features on the Patagonia Synchilla. The lack of pockets is one potential issue (aside from the famous snap chest pocket, of course), and you won’t get panels of fancy stretch fabrics or adjustments like some of the technical pieces. But it’s the fleece itself that matters here: soft, two-sided, and extremely cozy. Of the two available Synchilla versions, we like the lightweight best, which is 5.5 ounces lighter than the regular version but still surprisingly thick and warm. Keep in mind that the Synchilla Snap-T has a fairly roomy fit, much more so than the Better Sweater below. For a few more stylish options from Patagonia, it's worth checking out their Retro Pile and Classic Retro-X.See the Men's Patagonia Synchilla Snap-T  See the Women's Patagonia Synchilla Snap-T\n \nCategory: CasualWeight: 1 lb. 6.5 oz.Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: Classy looks and versatile performance.What we don’t: Thick and bulky; can feel a bit restrictive.\nPatagonia has more fleece options than just about any other gear company, ranging from the casual Synchilla Snap-T to the performance Regulator (R) series. Sitting conveniently in the middle is the popular Better Sweater, which can be used for anything from daily wear to light outdoor activities (it’s a great midlayer for resort skiing). Most of the colorways feature a muted heathered-knit aesthetic— earning the “sweater” in the name—but this fleece tacks on a lot of function compared to your standard cardigan, including interior and exterior pockets and an easy-to-launder polyester build that's 100% recycled. If you’re in the market for an everyday fleece and the Kyanite above is a bit too techy for your liking, the Better Sweater is a trusted and good-looking alternative.\nStyle is largely subjective, but in our opinion, the Better Sweater looks a lot more at home during the commute to the office than post-hike at the brewery (if it says anything, our 30s-something tester didn’t love it, but it’s now her mom’s favorite fleece). The thick fabric can also feel a touch restrictive, and it doesn’t help that the jacket runs a little small (you might need to size up). But if you want the performance of a fleece without looking like you just stepped out of the campground, it doesn’t get much better than the Better Sweater. And for the full suite of options, Patagonia also offers the design in hoody (women's only), 1/4-zip, and vest varieties... Read in-depth reviewSee the Men's Patagonia Better Sweater  See the Women's Patagonia Better Sweater\n \nCategory: CasualFleece weight: Light/midweightWhat we like: Retro styling and unique colorways.What we don’t: Not warm enough for most winter uses.\nPerformance fleeces can offer serious midlayer warmth for skiing and hiking, but sometimes you just want to throw on a casual fleece and feel cozy. In this category, we really like the Teca Fleece Full-Zip, which combines Polartec Micro Fleece with Cotopaxi’s hallmark retro style. Cotopaxi uses all repurposed materials for the Teca, meaning that every production run results in different colorways, and each design is a limited edition. To round out the build, two handwarmer pockets give you functional storage for daily tasks or outdoor pursuits, and elastic binding at the cuffs and hem provide a nice seal against the elements.\nAt just $110, the Teca is a nice alternative to the Patagonia Lightweight Synchilla Snap-T above for those looking for a fun fleece for around-town use (it also comes in a hooded full-zip and both hooded and non-hooded pullover versions). You can certainly wear this Cotopaxi while hiking, skiing, climbing, biking—or whatever your adventure of choice—but it isn't as warm as many of the alternatives here, and also doesn't stuff down super small. In terms of build quality, Cotopaxi doesn't quite measure up to brands like Arc'teryx and Patagonia, but their products get the job done for casual use, and we love that they're made with repurposed materials. Finally, the Salt Lake City-based company recently announced that they're 100% carbon neutral, which is big news that sets a high standard for the outdoor industry.See the Men's Cotopaxi Teca Fleece  See the Women's Cotopaxi Teca Fleece\n \nCategory: PerformanceWeight: 7.2 oz.​Fleece weight: LightweightWhat we like: A snug-fitting and breathable performance fleece with an extra dose of warmth and wind protection at the chest.What we don’t: Thin back material is vulnerable to wind.\nBlack Diamond's popular Coefficient is a warm yet snug-fitting layer for performance use, akin to the Patagonia R1 discussed above. But the real treat in the Coefficient lineup is the LT Hybrid, which thins out the Polartec Power Grid fleece fabric significantly (119 gsm vs. the standard Coefficient's 180) and adds a sleek layer of Primaloft Silver synthetic fill at the chest (covered in stretch-woven nylon). The result is the feel and warmth of a sleek fleece in the back and arms, with an added boost of wind resistance and insulation at the front. Tack on a fairly slim fit, under-the-helmet hood, and zippered chest pocket, and the Coefficient LT Hybrid has become our jacket of choice for hiking and rock climbing on mild shoulder-season days.\nHybrid performance fleeces are becoming standard in our personal repertoires (the Patagonia Nano-Air Light Hybrid is one of our favorites). They're breathable yet weather-resistant (at the front) and cozier than a straight synthetic jacket. They also generally have a snugger fit than standard fleeces, which is a boon for performance use and great for layering as well. It is worth noting that the Coefficient LT Hybrid's thin back material can be very vulnerable to wind (especially if you're not wearing a backpack), but it's perfect for dumping heat during moderate- to high-output activity. If you're looking for something a little different than the average fleece, this hybrid is a great place to start.See the Men's BD Coefficient LT Hybrid  See the Women's BD Coefficient LT Hybrid\n \nCategory: Casual/performanceWeight: 1 lb. 2.2 oz.Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: Quality materials and good looks.What we don’t: Pricey and a little overbuilt for everyday wear.\nIf you've worn Fjallraven apparel in the past, you may be drooling over the Keb Fleece. In typical fashion, this jacket has a high-end look and feel that few other brands are able to emulate. For the build, Fjallraven uses a unique polyester and wool blend that does a nice job at keeping you warm while still retaining a decent amount of moisture-wicking ability and stretch. We also like the simple but effective storage layout, including two nicely sized hand pockets and one smaller chest pocket. The end result is a very comfortable and functional fleece that also looks decidedly smart. \nLike many Fjallraven products, the Keb Fleece toes the line between casual and performance use. The fleece blend, reinforced G-1000 shoulder panels (it wouldn't be Fjallraven without some G-1000 in the mix), and aggressive hood are built for the outdoors, but the clean design and attractive colorways wear decently well in the city too. It doesn't have the outright casual appeal of designs like the Patagonia Synchilla or REI Trailmade above (the fit is decidedly on the athletic side), and you're certainly paying a steep premium at $210. But there's no denying that the Keb is another classy piece of gear from the Swedish company. For a lighter-weight option from Fjallraven with similar styling, check out their $55-cheaper Abisko Trail Fleece.See the Men's Fjallraven Keb Fleece  See the Women's Fjallraven Keb Fleece\n \nCategory: CasualWeight: 1 lb. 3.2 oz.​Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: A great value for a quality full-zip fleece.What we don’t: Build quality can’t quite match the Arc’teryx or Patagonia models above.\nWe were immediately impressed when trying on the Kuhl Interceptr, which feels like a more economical sibling of the Patagonia Better Sweater above (it has more technical features too). For a very reasonable $139, you get an athletic-fitting fleece jacket with tons of storage (four pockets in total) and handy features like articulated five-panel sleeves with thumbholes at the end to keep your hands warm and the sleeves in place.\nThe Interceptr does great in mild fall and spring conditions, but don’t expect much in the way of wind resistance or warmth when the temperature really drops. For just $20 more, the Patagonia Better Sweater offers more warmth in a similar style. Plus, we don’t love the dual chest pockets of the Interceptr, especially for a casual layer. But if you’ve tried Kuhl products in the past and like the brand and styling, the Interceptr is a solid value. For an even cheaper option from Kuhl with a trimmed-down feature set, see their popular Revel Quarter-Zip.See the Men's Kuhl Interceptr Fleece Jacket\n \nCategory: PerformanceWeight: 12.6 oz.Fleece weight: LightweightWhat we like: Stretchy and breathable for high-output use.What we don’t: Not very warm or versatile for wearing around town.\nLightweight performance fleeces are a growing trend, and we like what Outdoor Research has come up with in the Vigor Grid. This trim-fitting midlayer slips nicely over a thin baselayer and provides a great combination of stretch, breathability, and modest warmth. In terms of construction, it uses a polyester/spandex mix and tacks on an ActiveTemp treatment, which helps keep you cool and dry while sweating. In practice, we found the Vigor Grid to be a nice companion for cool-weather backpacking and expect it to be a great match for activities like running and backcountry skiing, too.\nWhere the Vigor Grid comes up short is versatility. The jacket isn’t all that warm for low-output pursuits and has very little appeal as a casual piece. In fact, the trim fit makes it feel a lot like a souped-up baselayer, although its smooth face is more durable than the exposed jacquard of the R1 Air above (we’ve found it to be a nice standalone jacket for cool-weather rock climbing). And whether it’s seen as a strength or weakness, the jacket runs very long—great for coverage, but expect it to poke out under the hem of your outer layer. Gripes aside, the Vigor Grid Fleece is a highly functional midlayer and comes complete with thumb holes, a flat-seam construction to minimize chafing, and useful chest and handwarmer pockets.See the Men's OR Vigor Grid Hoodie  See the Women's OR Vigor Grid 1/4 Zip\n \nCategory: CasualWeight: 1 lb. 1.6 oz.Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: A stylish sweatshirt fleece with performance chops.What we don’t: Baggy design is not great for layering; no stretch.\nThe Arc'teryx Kyanite above is a versatile fleece for both performance and casual use, but for more style points, check out their everyday-minded Covert collection. The Covert Pullover here is a souped-up version of your favorite cotton hoodie: It's comfortable, warm, roomy, and adds a nice dose of class with subdued colorways and a wool-like appearance. What's more, the 100% polyester build doesn't grow heavy when wet, so it can easily pull double duty for cool-weather hiking or as a midlayer for resort skiing in mild temperatures. \nBut at $180, you'll have to be a real fan of the style to spring for the Covert Pullover Hoody. The baggy fit also isn't ideal for layering (although an oversized ski or snowboard jacket will slide over just fine), and we've read reports of the neck being on the tight side. What's more, there's virtually no stretch in the material, and—like many fleeces—it has a tendency to pill. For a jacket more akin to the Better Sweater above, Arc'teryx does offer the Covert in a classic cardigan design for the same price, along with a 1/2-zip pullover, full-zip hoody, and simple crew neck for women.See the Men's Arc'teryx Covert Pullover  See the Women's Covert Pullover Hoody\n \nCategory: PerformanceWeight: 11 oz.Fleece weight: Light/midweightWhat we like: Lightweight fleece panels add mobility and venting.What we don’t: Only comes in a hooded version; just one chest pocket.\nU.K.-based Rab makes some of our favorite down jackets and hardshells for demanding backcountry use, so it comes as little surprise that their fleece jackets are impressively well built and competitive. From their collection, the Ascendor is a high-performance pick that offers a modern take on the classic midweight design. The jacket is made up of two different weights of grid-backed fleece: You get 235-gram fleece at the torso, hips, shoulders, and upper arms, along with a lighter-weight blend at the back, lower arms, and hood that snugs up the fit and goes a long way to increase mobility and venting. Tack on a low-profile brushed finish and trim-fitting hood that slides easily underneath a climbing helmet, and the result is a decently warm yet breathable performance piece built for action.\nPerformance-wise, the Ascendor is a nice step up from a jacket like the OR Vigor Grid above thanks to its mix of lightweight and midweight fleece. It also trims down weight and bulk with just one chest pocket, which could be a pro or a con depending on your preferences (it’s a tight fit for even the smallest of smartphones). It’s worth noting that not everyone will prefer a hood for midlayer use (they can get in the way under a hardshell), and Rab only offers the Ascendor as a hoody, while the Vigor comes in a variety of hoodless designs. For better standalone performance, check out the Ascendor Summit Full Zip Hoody ($200), which tacks on windproof and water-resistant fabric in high-exposure areas and is a strong competitor to the Black Diamond Coefficient LT Hybrid Hoody above.See the Men's Rab Ascendor Hoody  See the Women's Rab Ascendor Hoody\nCategory: CasualFleece weight: Light/midweightWhat we like: Nice looks and great price.What we don’t: Not as well-made or versatile as the Patagonia Better Sweater.\nIt doesn’t get much more classic than the L.L. Bean Sweater Fleece Full-Zip. From the throwback logo on the chest to the knit exterior and wide range of muted colorways, the jacket is an everyday staple. The middle-of-the-road fit (L.L. Bean calls it “slightly fitted”) slides easily over a long-sleeve baselayer or dress shirt, although it is a bit bulky for wearing under a rain shell. And you don’t get a waist cinch for truly sealing out the cold, but the light-to-midweight insulation, drop hem, and lined hand pockets make the Sweater Fleece a nice match for many spring and fall days.\nIn many ways, this L. L. Bean is a budget alternative to Patagonia’s Better Sweater above. Both have a timeless look, similar pocket layouts, and a lot of around-town appeal with their moderate levels of warmth. Where the Patagonia gets the edge is its very cozy interior, which uses higher-quality fleece. Plus,it’s longer-lasting and less prone to pilling excessively over time (this is especially valuable if you’ll be wearing the jacket for activities like downhill skiing). But for a substantial $60 savings, it’s hard to argue with the simple L.L. Bean for daily use.See the Men's L.L. Bean Sweater Fleece  See the Women's L.L. Bean Sweater Fleece\n \nCategory: Performance/casualWeight: 15.8 oz.Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: A performance Polartec fleece at a reasonable price.What we don’t: Overkill for casual use.\nSeattle-based REI knows a thing or two about the importance of a good fleece—they’re useful in the Pacific Northwest about 9 months a year. But breaking in tradition from more basic fleeces like the Trailmade above, the Co-op has put together a surprisingly modern and performance-oriented design in the Hyperaxis 2.0. It’s true that $149 is expensive for an REI in-house product, but with this fleece you get premium Polartec Power Stretch Pro fabric, low-profile seams, and even features like thumb loops. The result is a good-looking, well-built, and versatile jacket.\nIn many ways, the REI Co-op Hyperaxis 2.0 does a pretty darn good impersonation of pricier jackets like the Patagonia R1 TechFace above. All three performance fleeces use a stretchy and moisture-wicking shell fabric and are built to breathe during high-intensity movement. But with the Patagonia, you get a bit more weather protection by way of a robust shell with a DWR finish. All in all, it’s tough to beat the looks and quality of these premium brands, but the more affordable Hyperaxis 2.0 isn’t far behind. See the Men's REI Hyperaxis 2.0  See the Women's REI Hyperaxis 2.0\n \nCategory: CasualWeight: 1 lb. 0.6 oz.​Fleece weight: MidweightWhat we like: Tons of colors and sizes.What we don’t: Durability is questionable.\nSoft, inexpensive, and offered in a ton of sizes and colors, the Steens Mountain is a very popular budget fleece. First and foremost, this is a very simple jacket: The fabric is basic, and you don't get any features to speak of. But it provides decent warmth and styling and a hefty portion of coziness, especially for the price (the full list price is supposedly $65, but it gets sold for $45 across all retailers).\nIt’s a good idea to set reasonable expectations for a fleece in this price range. For its weight and bulk, the Steens Mountain does very little to trap warmth or keep out wind, nor is it super breathable. It’s also not trim-fitting and layers poorly under a hardshell. To put it simply, the Steens Mountain won’t be your workhorse for any kind of serious outdoor use. But if you’re looking for an inexpensive layering piece to wear around town, Columbia’s bottom-shelf offering should get the job done.See the Men's Columbia Steens Mountain  See the Women's Columbia Benton Springs\n \n \nWhat's cozier than pulling on your favorite fleece on a chilly day? Not much, in our opinion. This guide was originally put together in 2015 by former editors John Ellings and Jenny Abegg. It started with a modest eight picks, some of which have remained in our lineup ever since—most notably, the Patagonia Better Sweater and The North Face Denali. For 2024, our list has expanded to 17 competitive options, spanning everything from casual day-to-day designs to more technical, performance-ready layering pieces. Whatever your needs are, we feel confident that you'll find something here that's perfect for keeping the cold at bay. \nSenior editor Chris Carter and editor-in-chief Penney Garrett now manage this guide, and it's a labor of love—every chance we get, we're snatching up new fleece jackets to test out in the field. From backpacking to hiking to skiing, we've pushed many of these layers to their limits—and also enjoyed their coziness on rest and travel days. We assess every spec, from material composition to the quality of the components, and try to sweat, shiver, and get rained on in each one. The available options are always changing and growing, so rest assured we will continue to update this list as new and exciting products hit the market.\n \nFleece is a man-made material designed to mimic wool, first created in the late '70s or early '80s by a wool apparel company called Malden Mills (fun fact: Malden Mills went bankrupt in the 2000s and re-emerged as Polartec—the current industry giant). Fleece is made from petroleum that is formed into strings, which are then woven into fabric. Although it’s synthetic, fleece shares a number of properties with wool: It traps air and is thus very insulative, naturally repels water (making it quick-drying and fairly water-resistant), and is very breathable. And unlike wool, fleece is machine-washable and hypoallergenic—and, of course, it’s vegan too. \n \nAs an outerwear material, fleece is fairly distinct from other insulators such as down and synthetic fill. For one, it's less expensive, and despite its tendency to pill, it can be fairly durable (just don't get it too close to a flame—it will melt). It's also cozier and significantly more breathable, which has massive benefits as a midlayer or an insulator in casual and performance settings. But fleece can't quite match the warmth-to-weight ratio of down especially, and it's not as water-resistant as synthetic insulation (most synthetic jackets feature a nylon shell with a DWR finish). There's certainly a time and place—we love our fleeces for resort skiing, rock climbing (particularly hybrid designs), hiking, and of course casual use—but they're not our first choice for fast-and-light missions or serious endeavors when we want maximum warmth efficiency or weather resistance.\n \nFleece was originally designed to mimic a sheep’s hide and wool, meaning traditional varieties had a high-pile exterior and smooth interior. But given its fully synthetic makeup, the category has now evolved into a variety of forms, from thick sherpa fleece to sleek grid-backed fabrics. Really, the sky's the limit—if you want an example of how many different styles of fleeces there are in 2024, check out the fabrics section on Polartec’s website. Below, we break down the fleece types displayed in the jackets above (our list is by no means comprehensive).Polar Fleece\nImagine a thick fleece jacket akin to The North Face's Denali, and you’ve got polar fleece: A simple, double-sided fabric that’s warm, cozy, and more prone to pilling than most. Polar fleece is such a staple that its name was co-opted by the brand Polartec, responsible for high-end fleeces like Polartec Alpha and Polartec Power Stretch Pro. Polar fleece is very simple compared to more tech-savvy fabrics: You don’t get any windproofing or water resistance, no special breathability or weight-saving measures, and no gridded patterns. But it still hits all the features that we look for in a fleece and is affordable to boot. Note: In thinner varieties (less than 200 gsm), polar fleece is often referred to as microfleece.\n \nKnit Fleece\nKnit fleece, or sweater-knit fleece, is epitomized by jackets like the Patagonia Better Sweater and Arc'teryx Covert, which feature a heathered knit face fabric (reminiscent of wool) alongside a cozy, brushed interior that acts and feels like traditional fleece. Jackets with knit fleece are prized for their classy looks, pill resistance, and warmth, and are great alternatives to wool cardigans or jackets. On the other hand, their fairly thick and bulky build means they’re not an ideal choice for serious outdoor use.Gridded Fleece\nWhereas sweater-knit fleece is a very casual material, gridded fleece (also known as waffle or thermal fleece) goes the opposite direction with a high-performance slant. Characterized by fleeces like the classic Patagonia R1 (which uses Polartec’s Power Grid) and Outdoor Research Vigor Grid, the interior of a gridded fleece features patterns of raised fleece (squares, circles, or hexagons, for example) with channels in between for air to flow. On the exterior, you often get a smooth surface that distributes moisture to speed up evaporation. The result is maximum warmth and breathability with minimal weight and bulk—the difference in breathability is particularly palpable compared to other types of fleece. Note: While the Patagonia R1 Air is technically defined as a jacquard fleece (meaning that a raised pattern is woven into its material), for all intents and purposes, it fits into the gridded fleece category.\n \nSherpa/Faux-Shearling Fleece\nSherpa fleece is about as close as you can get to fleece’s origin story without dipping into shearling wool (for this reason, it’s also commonly called faux-shearling fleece). On one side, you get a smooth knit backer (if we’re drawing comparisons, this would be the sheep’s hide); on the other, you get a lofty, high-pile fleece that’s reminiscent of unprocessed wool. We don't include any sherpa fleece jackets on our list above, but the Patagonia Retro Pile Fleece is a popular design with double-sided shearling (the faux-wool material is both on the interior and exterior). Sherpa fleece is bulky and decidedly casual, but if you’re looking for the epitome of cozy, this is it.Other Dual-Surface Fleeces\nMany gridded and sherpa fleeces feature a smooth side and a fleecy side (ironically, gridded fleeces generally place the fleecy side next to skin, while sherpa fleeces do the opposite), but they’re not the only types of fleece that fall into the dual-surface category. Here we want to specifically highlight Polartec’s Power Stretch Pro material, which is almost sweatshirt-like in nature with a soft polar fleece on the interior and smooth, low-friction exterior. With this construction, Power Stretch Pro and other similar blends retain all the benefits we love about fleece while adding excellent range of motion, shape retention, and durability. For a closer look at this technology, check out offerings like the Arc’teryx Kyanite above.\n \nIn general, we can organize fleeces into two main categories: casual and performance. Casual fleeces provide an unbeatable combination of coziness and warmth for everyday use. They are terrific for layering on chilly evenings, wearing around the cabin, and daily commutes. Our favorite casual fleeces range from sweater-knit designs that dress up nicely (the Patagonia Better Sweater, for example) to basic pieces that are little more than the fabric itself. And while many fleeces on our list are intended for performance use, in reality, they can all be worn in casual settings (when we first got our R1 Air, we never wanted to take it off). That’s the glory of fleece: Unlike many pieces of activewear, fleece’s hallmark features of warmth, comfort, and breathability cross over seamlessly for daily wear.\n \nPerformance fleeces have a number of common attributes: They’re snug-fitting (unlike many casual offerings, which can be on the boxy side) and stretchy, feature high-tech fabrics like Polartec Power Stretch Pro and Alpha, and often include hoods and thumb loops. Hybrid fleece/synthetic jackets also fall into the performance category (more on these below), in addition to fleeces with weather-resistant face fabrics (such as Patagonia’s TechFace collection). When deciding on a performance fleece, it’s worth thinking about your needs in terms of weather protection, mobility, warmth, and packability. There’s virtually something for everyone.\n \nFor an idea of how warm a particular fleece will be, some jackets list the fabric thickness or fleece weight. This is often expressed in terms of grams per square meter—100, 200, and 300-gram, for example—and some brands have come up with their own rating system (Patagonia's R1 and R2, for instance). In its lightest form, a fleece is only a small step up in terms of insulation from a baselayer (the Black Diamond Coefficient LT Hybrid is one example) and ideal for high-output activities when breathability wins out over maximum warmth. Midweight or 200-weight fleeces are warmer and make a great pairing for fall and spring or mild-weather days on the slopes. Heavy fleeces of the 300-weight variety are warm and can insulate when temperatures dip below freezing, but their bulk often comes at the cost of mobility and breathability. \nAs more companies have moved toward designing their own in-house fleeces and Polartec has diversified their offerings, the demarcation isn’t quite as simple as explained above. But it’s still helpful when available, and in general, the weight of the fleece correlates with its warmth. The heavier a jacket is, the more likely it will be able to keep you warm and block wind from entering.\n \nAlthough often worn as standalone pieces, fleece jackets are not intended to combat heavy wind or rain. The synthetic fabric itself is hydrophobic (i.e., it won't absorb moisture), but wind and water can make their way through the porous construction rather easily. What's more, unlike down or synthetic jackets, fleeces—even dual-surface designs with low-friction exteriors—do not feature a durable water-repellent (DWR) finish. Some, like the classic The North Face Denali and Cotopaxi Teca, incorporate non-fleece nylon panels that can repel light amounts of precipitation, but these only cover a few inches across the chest.\nWe'll sometimes see manufacturers add a tough, weather-resistant shell to boost the wind and water protection of fleece. The Patagonia R1 TechFace Hoody, for example, pairs gridded fleece with a woven softshell exterior. This style—which we call hard-face fleece—is a great alternative to a full-blown softshell, and it's cozier, too. But while hard-face fleeces are impressively wind-resistant and can fend off light moisture—great for PNW commutes and shoulder-season days in the mountains—we don't recommend them for all-out rain. In truly wet weather, you'll still want a more reliable rain jacket or hardshell.\n \nA notable upside to fleeces is their breathability, which is one of the primary reasons that they work so well as a midlayer. Compared to a softshell, down, or synthetic insulated jacket, a fleece is dotted with tiny openings—hold a fleece up to the sun, and you’ll see light streaming through—which helps a great deal with airflow. And of course, the thinner the fabric, generally the more breathable the fleece will be. On the other hand, it also contributes to their shortcomings as a true outer layer in the cold and wind. As we mentioned above, some hybrid fleeces include wind-resistant fabrics, making them less permeable to air, but keep in mind that while these styles offer more protection against the elements, breathability takes a back seat. If we know we’re venturing out in inclement weather, we usually prefer to pair a baselayer with a windbreaker jacket, or wear a softshell or synthetic insulated jacket with wind-blocking fabric instead.\n \nFleece jackets range widely in terms of fit, and it's important to look into the jacket's intended use to make sure it aligns with your own. Performance pieces like the Outdoor Research Vigor Grid have a trim cut that is designed to remove excess fabric for added mobility and efficient ventilation. While very effective on the mountain, the style doesn't always translate well to urban life. If you're in search of a jacket adept at both, something like the Arc'teryx Kyanite may be the ideal choice, with enough room to be comfortable but not so loose as to be useless in the backcountry. For casual wear, a roomier fit option like the Patagonia Synchilla Snap-T or one of the other budget options may be the ticket.\n \nHood \nMany fleeces are offered in either hooded or non-hooded varieties. For use as a classic midlayer, we typically lean towards a non-hooded option, as even a low-profile hood can get in the way underneath your shell (unless you always use both hoods). And for pairing under a ski jacket, it’s a no-brainer to go with a non-hooded model. Alternatively, a hood is a welcome addition in colder conditions, and many are nicely fitted and stay in place even while exercising. For climbing and backcountry skiing—and particularly if you’re planning on wearing your fleece as an outer layer—a hood can be a really nice feature, and we appreciate both under- and over-the-helmet varieties.\nThumbholes \nPerformance fleeces designed for activities like running or cross-country skiing will occasionally have thumbholes built into the sleeves. While serving as an opening for cold air to sneak in when not in use, the openings work well for keeping the sleeves in place during high-effort activities or when taking on and off layers. User tip: If you’re eyeing a jacket that has this feature, we recommend checking to make sure the fabric around the thumbhole has some stretch so it doesn’t feel like your thumb is being yanked around when you extend your arms. \n \nFull-Zip vs. Pullover\nMost of the jackets toward the top of our list are of the full-zip variety, which gives you maximum versatility and is easy to slip on and off. Full-zip models tend to have more features like hand pockets and stretchy side panels, whereas pullovers are more basic and function like a sweatshirt (albeit a very comfy one). The upside of fleece pullovers is that they weigh slightly less, pack down smaller, and generally are cheaper. The Patagonia Lightweight Synchilla Snap-T is an extremely popular fleece pullover that in many ways defines the category.\n \nBuilding off the fleece types above, it’s become more and more common to see fleece paired with synthetic insulation—a combination known as a “hybrid” jacket. Most commonly, these jackets feature a fleece back with a synthetically insulated front (often finished with a nylon or polyester shell), which maximizes breathability alongside warmth and weather protection. The breathable back is especially nice when wearing a backpack, and we love the added tech at the front for wind-generating activities like trail running, backcountry skiing, and Nordic skiing. High-quality examples of this design include the Black Diamond Coefficient LT Hybrid and Patagonia Nano-Air Light Hybrid.\n \nAnimal-derived insulators like down and wool get a bad rap from environmental advocates (and in many cases, rightly so), but fleece isn’t without blame either. Polyester fleece is a synthetic, petroleum-based material, which means a few things. For one, it’s plastic—in fact, it’s made up of the same stuff as those single-use plastic bottles many of us try to avoid. Second, unlike sustainably produced natural materials like cotton or down, the production of fleece can result in greenhouse gas emissions and potentially unsafe work environments. And finally, fleece sheds throughout its lifetime, littering microplastics in its wake—as multiple studies have shown, one single fleece jacket can release thousands of fibers into wastewater with each wash. Given the current state of plastics in our oceans, this is not good news.\n \nBut there are steps we can take to address this issue. Companies like Patagonia and Polartec produce most of their polyester fabrics (including fleece) from recycled plastic bottles, which both reduces emissions and repurposes materials that might otherwise end up in a landfill. At the time of publishing, 92% of Patagonia's polyester fabrics are derived from recycled materials. We're also seeing manufacturers increase their use of natural fabrics—yes, even in fleece—including hemp, lyocell, wool, and bamboo. Unlike the microplastics in polyester fleece, fibers that shed from these materials actually biodegrade. And then that leaves you, the consumer. You can do your part by following the three R's (reduce your consumption, reuse what you have, buy products made with recycled materials), and when you can, seek out clothing made with natural, rather than synthetic, fibers. Finally, consider purchasing a wash bag (like this one from Guppyfriend), which will keep your fleece's microplastics out of your washing's wastewater.\n \nPilling is one of the downsides of a low-quality fleece, and even a nicer option can start losing fleece over time. Once a jacket starts pilling up, it’s difficult to reverse the process, so prevention is key here. One of the best ways to extend the life of your fleece is keeping it clear of a drier. Line drying or at least tumble-drying on low will do wonders, and some have had success washing their fleeces on the delicate wash cycle. Also, while fleece jackets are a popular choice for hanging around the campfire, do your best to keep yours clear of the flames. The plasticky construction will melt when exposed to extreme heat. Beyond those considerations, fleeces are easy to maintain and should give you years of comfy service.\n \nThe midlayer market is chock full of options, and fleece’s two primary competitors are synthetic jackets and down jackets. Both are more expensive but offer improved warmth relative to their weight and are far more packable. Further, synthetic jackets provide better protection against wind and rain (although some modern fleeces aren’t far behind). But if breathability and a soft next-to-skin feel are at the top of your list, a fleece remains our go-to choice. Synthetic and down jackets require a lining and outer shell to hold the insulation, which impacts comfort and the ability to pull away sweat and hot air. As a result, the fleece excels at aerobic activities when bulk isn’t as much of a concern, such as resort skiing and day hiking. But in the end, none are the end-all-be-all insulating layer, which is why it is common for people to own one (or more) of each.Back to Our Top Fleece Jacket Picks  Back to Our Fleece Jacket Comparison Table\n We independently evaluate all of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\n\nThese jackets will keep you warm and comfortable in any destination.\nIn This Article\nTravel + Leisure / Sam Warren\n Fleece jackets are one of the few pieces of clothing that you can wear as your main top at social events, underneath a thicker coat while skiing, or even as a cozy pajama shirt in the comfort of your own home. Fleece is soft and versatile, and its functionality can rival even the most technical coats and shirts. With proper care, they can also last for years.\n\n It can be difficult to find the right fleece jacket for you, so we tested 30 from popular brands like The North Face, Kühl, Helly Hansen, L.L.Bean, and more to see which ones excelled in fit, design, performance, durability, and value. During the process, we tested each piece in multiple scenarios, from exercise to errands, to see how they performed (you can find more insight on our testing process below). Whatever your specifications are, a jacket on this list will fit the bill.\n\nThe block-color design pairs well with almost anything.\nIt can be boxy on slimmer body types.\n The Denali Zip Jacket from The North Face is one of the most ubiquitous jackets available today for good reason. We chose it as our best overall because of its lightweight, breathable fabric, while still being extremely warm. Its relaxed fit and flexible fabric allow for a full range of motion, and there’s enough room to wear one or two layers beneath it. We love that it comes in a wide range of colors, from the neutral black to more unique colors like “chlorophyll green digital distortion” and “fawn gray.” The recycled-nylon block overlay is an iconic look for all ages, and it also provides wind protection. The jacket is also flexible, featuring a shock cord and lock on the waist to adjust the bottom’s size.\n\n During testing we determined that the Denali performed the best across a wide range of activities: we wore it on chilly mornings, in the car, and doing errands in 30- to 60-degree weather and it was both cozy and breathable. It grabbed the highest score possible in each of our categories, but it particularly scored well in comfortability. We haven’t seen something look good and function as well across the board as the Denali.\n\n The Details: XS to 3XL | Polyester, nylon | Full-zip\n\nIt’s extremely soft.\nAfter five months of regular wear and multiple washes, the color has begun to fade.\n L.L.Bean’s Sweater Fleece Full-Zip Jacket is the ideal go-to daily sweater fleece because of its simple and practical cut and fuzzy softness. In testing, we wore this three to four times per week to different places and events. Because of its full-zip feature, it’s easy to take this jacket on and off in just a few seconds — which is especially helpful on airplanes, trains, and cars. It has a loose fit, which makes it adaptable to the shirts you may be wearing on any given day.\n\n The polyester fleece is free of static and clinging (which pleasantly surprised us because of how soft it is), and it has proper anti-odor capabilities, which helped the Sweater Fleece Full-Zip earn its spot as the best jacket for day-to-day use. We threw this in with our other clothes on a cold-water cycle and after about five months of washing it regularly, we did notice some minor discoloration. However, it seems to be in good shape otherwise. At under $100, this is a great jacket to pick up for daily use — you may even want to get it in multiple shades.\n\n The Details: S to 3XL | Polyester | Full-zip\n\nWearing it feels like a cozy fleece throw blanket.\nThere are limited colorway options.\n The Panorama Pile Fleece from Helly Hansen features plush fleece made from 100 percent recycled polyester and a high neck that’s great for protection against the elements. In the fall, it works as a solo jacket, but as our five-month test entered winter, we felt that this was best used as a mid-layer. With sleeves long enough for outstretched arms, the jacket includes thumb holes that let it act as a pseudo pair of gloves. We noticed that the air flow was minimal during our testing activities. While great for hikes and stationary activities, we wouldn’t wear this on a jog due to potential overheating. Unlike some other fleece jackets, you can wash the Panorama Pile Fleece at the same as other laundry rather than washing it separately. Sometimes lesser quality fleece jackets can get all out of sorts in the washing machine, but this one held up great when we washed it in a cold-wash cycle and dried it in a medium-hot cycle. Because of the quality, we're even more likely to recommend this now than we were at the beginning of testing.\n\n The Details: S to XXL | Polyester | Full-zip\n\nThe sleeves and body are sewn specifically for a wider range of motion.\nThe fabric pills after a few washes.\n The Interceptr features two different types of fleece fabrics: one for breathable movement and one for core warmth, all in one piece. We wore the jacket both indoors and out for several hours to see how it held up with movement. It regulated body temperature well and stored adequate warmth, though we felt air movement in the wind. Kühl designed the Interceptr to cover your body and arms regardless of the activity. Due to the articulated sleeves, our arms and wrists stayed perfectly shielded and the bottom of the jacket didn’t ride up the waist.\n\n This jacket is ideal for anyone who is active outside or moves from indoors to outdoors frequently due to its temperature-management capabilities. It’s even useful during freezing weather if paired with a light layer on top. It also offers ample storage, with two chest pockets and two hand-warming side pockets. We also think it looks versatile enough to wear for many different occasions. Throughout our five-month testing period, we washed it on delicate with cold water and hung it up to dry, and found the fabric to become even softer and more comfortable with each wash.\n\n The Details: S to 3XL | Acrylic, polyester | Full-zip\n\nIt works as a functional or fashionable jacket and has plenty of colorways.\nIt’s not particularly breathable.\n For a basic, reliable fleece jacket at a smart price, we recommend the Steens Mountain 2.0 Full Zip Fleece Jacket from Columbia. It has soft yet durable fleece material, zippered pockets, and a waist drawcord to customize the fitting. It fits true to size but also has room for one or two base layers underneath. During our tests, we determined that it uses a top-tier fleece fabric after we washed it with our normal sweats, and it came out looking and feeling the same. It’s available in over a dozen different colors and different fit variations like “standard,” “big,” and “tall.”\n\n Its two-tone design offers flexibility for different outfits, and we experienced a wide range of motion, though we don’t recommend it for high-intensity workouts due to its lack of breathability. Still, after five months of use it still looks new and the quality is unbeatable for its price tag — it's the most affordable option on this list.\n\n The Details: S to XXL | Polyester | Full-zip\n\nIt has a stylish vintage look and a tall collar.\nThroughout our five-month test, we noticed the inside fabric is a bit rough with a scratchy texture that can be uncomfortable.\n Patagonia is known for outfitting frat guys and tech bros alike. The Classic Retro-X Fleece Jacket looks like it came right out of the 1980s with shaggy, high-pile fleece; retro colors; and a high-rise collar. The fleece looks like a sheep’s body, feels natural, and during testing it kept us warm on cold New York City days by the water. It’s fairly breathable, while also doing a good job of trapping heat and blocking the wind. We machine-washed it with other clothes and dried it on low, and the fabric felt the same as it did before the cycle. While you may be partially paying for the name brand and its initiatives like Patagonia’s Fair Trade manufacturing, we rated the Classic Retro-X as the Best Splurge because of its unique fabric, stylish appearance, and superior functionality during our five-month testing period.\n\n The Details: XXS to XXL | Polyester, nylon | Full-zip\n\nThis jacket can be worn indoors, outdoors, and for a wide range of activities.\nAfter two months, the zipper split at the bottom and needed to be repaired.\n If you’re looking for a jacket that is best for the environment, we recommend the Teca Fleece Full-Zip Jacket from Cotopaxi. The shell is made of 100 percent recycled polyester fleece, and the stripes across the chest are made of repurposed polyester. After testing this jacket out, we recommend wearing more than just a T-shirt with it if you’ll be in temperatures less than 50 degrees. The jacket is stylish with a tri-color stripe but also performs well for high-intensity, high-movement workouts. It also scored the highest marks in each of our testing categories.\n\n It features two hand pockets on the sides for extra hand warmth. Washed in cold water, this jacket air-dries quickly. Cotopaxi offers a generous lifetime warranty, simple returns and exchanges, and you can even trade in your old gear for store credit, which we’re big fans of because it encourages thoughtful consumerism. After plenty of use during five months of testing, it is still in great condition, aside from a zipper repair we needed in month two.\n\n The Details: XS to 3XL | Polyester | Full-zip\n\nIt’s extremely warm for chilly days.\nDuring testing, we noticed some strings came loose from seams on the body and arms of the jacket.\n If you prefer thick, scruffy materials versus the short-and-soft fleece you may be used to, the Bean’s Sherpa Fleece Jacket is for you. The body is made of 100 percent recycled polyester, with nylon and polyester linings. The sleeves have classic ribbed cuffs to limit cold air slipping to the arms. We tested this in multiple settings over a period of five months, both indoors and outdoors, and appreciated the fitted look and versatility in different environments. You can get by with just this jacket and one or two undershirts because the high-pile material holds warmth extremely well. We wore this with a T-shirt and hoodie underneath, and it still looked good. While it’s great for hikes or relaxing, we wouldn’t recommend you go for any runs in this because its thickness could cause overheating. Despite its thick fabric, there was no pilling or shrinking after washing.\n\n The Details: S to 3XL | Polyester, nylon, acrylic, spandex | Full-zip\n\nIts material is thin while still being warm.\nThe zipper hangs to the side, not straight.\n Guys who are always on the go will appreciate the Trailmade Fleece’s lightness and versatility. You can wear this as a standalone jacket for workouts, or combine it with more layers for colder temperatures. When we tried it out, we found that it was ideal for travel because of its packability, and we were able to wear it for days at a time. We don’t recommend wearing more than a basic T-shirt underneath as it could get too crowded. While there are five available colors, we wish there were a few more neutral options like gray or white for more casual use. Washing this jacket from REI is easy — we put it in with the other loads and the fabric felt unaffected and the colors did not bleed into other clothes. Throughout our five months of tests, we washed this fleece several times a week and it still shows no visible signs of wear.\n\n The Details: S to 3XL | Polyester, spandex | Full-zip\n\nIt’s especially stretchy for fleece material — great for base layers.\nIt’s not the warmest for colder days and we found it to run small.\n This pullover hoodie from Outdoor Research is less of a cozy hoodie and more of a high-performance long sleeve with a hood and some additional features. The grid-pattern fleece has a proprietary treatment that keeps the body cool and dry during sweaty workouts. The hood features a balaclava that’s great for when wind hits your face and thumb holes on the sleeves keep it from rolling up your arms. If you have any accessories like keys or AirPods, the left-chest zip pocket provides handy storage. This fleece also has UPF 30 protection and a lifetime guarantee, which we appreciate, especially for outdoor runs and activities that require more durability against the elements. We also washed and dried it several times during five months of testing with a normal load and the fabric always came out unharmed. It isn't quite as warm as some other fleece options we've tried, so it's best used in milder weather.\n\n The Details: S to XXL | Polyester, spandex, nylon | Pullover\n\nThe recycled polyester fleece wicks moisture and dries quickly.\nIt doesn’t have side pockets.\n The Lightweight Synchilla Snap-T Fleece Pullover has been in Patagonia’s classic collection for years for good reasons. The fleece material is so soft and plush, we wore it around the house like a bathrobe. During the five-month testing period, we also wore it skiing and it kept us warm without minimizing movement. You won’t overheat in this, but it’s still breathable. Button snap closures up the neck allow for a relaxed or performance look. If you plan on skiing in weather lower than 50 degrees, we recommend this for its versatility. You can wear this around the lodge and under a bigger winter coat. While washing in hot water works well, we do recommend air-drying this to keep the fleece soft. We wish there was more storage, but the chest pocket can still hold smaller items, and at the end of our tests, we determined that we’d definitely purchase this again for more seasons on the slopes.\n\n The Details: XXS to 3XL | Polyester | Pullover with snap buttons\n\nIt offers superior wind protection.\nIt holds warmth inside, so be cautious on warmer days.\n We primarily tested the Hyperaxis 2.0 during outdoor activities and found it to be the most equipped for hiking and climbing. It hangs a little below the waist, so if you prefer a slightly oversized fit, this will be great. The material has four-way stretch and allows for a wide range of movement while also drying quickly and wicking sweat away from the body. The edge, cuffs, and hem have a Lycra spandex binding to ensure a tight fit without the need for a drawcord. But, after five months of tests, we did notice some pilling around the sleeve cuffs — otherwise, it held up well.\n\n If you plan on layering, it features thumb holes on the sleeves to keep the jacket in place. It has pockets on the chest and sides, which provide ample storage for long hours outside. For cleaning, we put it in a regular load and air-dried it, and the fabric came out feeling good as new.\n\n The Details: S to 3XL | Polyester, nylon, spandex | Full-zip\n\nThe heavyweight fleece is great for cold-to-freezing environments.\nAfter just a couple months of testing, we noticed the pockets' zippers easily snagged on other layers and even our hands when using.\n The Kühl Alpenwurx adds a touch of luxury and fashion to an otherwise straightforward piece of apparel. The Berber fleece collar looks like a classy, fur-trimmed coat, while providing a soft touch to the neck. We really enjoyed this as other jackets can cause friction on the skin, especially in the cold, dry weather. The sueded fabric patches on the shoulders and elbows offer a unique style, while also giving further protection to areas that are susceptible to wearing down over time. After five months of regular use, we feel like the fabric held up well and still looks good as new.\n\n When trying this jacket out, we found that air sometimes got in on colder days, but we never felt too hot indoors. This jacket is especially good for long drives or travel because of the articulated sleeves that remain in place during movement. The manufacturer recommends washing it in cold water and then laying it out flat to dry. A delicate cycle keeps this jacket’s fabric perfectly intact.\n\n The Details: S to XXL | Polyester | Full-zip\n\nIt’s simple, elegant, and ultra versatile.\nThere are no inside or chest pockets.\n Made with Arc’teryx’s technical Polartec Power Stretch Pro synthetic fleece, the Kyanite Jacket allows for top-tier airflow. The material also has a nylon face that offers strong resistance to abrasion. We found it to be on the thinner side, which made it extremely breathable, but it also stored warmth well. The material allows for motion and flexibility, great for workouts and quick movement. It comes in five colors and its stylish design allows it to be worn out casually.\n\n It fit almost perfectly and wasn’t too short or too long. It also would work for multiple body types. As long as you care for it properly, this jacket would perform well through many wears and washes. After five months of regular use and multiple washes, it still looks new. The only adjustment we’d make is the addition of a chest or interior pocket for more storage during other activities that may require extra tools.\n\n The Details: XS to XXL | Polyester, nylon, elastane | Full-zip\n\nThe hood can provide extra warmth and protection.\nAfter five months of regular use, some threads at the cuffs have started to come loose.\n The Global Midlayer Hoodie strikes the balance between function and fashion. Its grid-pattern fleece is soft enough on the skin as a base layer and strong enough to act as your solo outerwear. It features one zipper chest pocket, two zipper hand pockets, and a tight-fitting scuba hood, which would be great for quicker movements against the wind. We found it long enough to cover everything, but not overly baggy. Elastic on the wrists and waists also prevent too much air getting in. Also, if you have shorter arms, the elastic helps hold the sleeves in place.\n\n We appreciated the zippers, which stayed in place when we wore it. It’s excellent at holding warmth, but we wouldn’t recommend it in temperatures above 60 degrees as it could be too hot. We found the washing process to be extremely easy, throwing it in with other clothes, and normal detergent worked well. After five months of at-home use, we did notice some stitching became loose around the hood and wrists, which was unfortunate to see. Otherwise, the fabric has held up well.\n\n The Details: S to XXL | Polyester, spandex | Full-zip\n\nThis is a great in-between piece when you need more than a thin jacket and less than a full coat.\nDuring our initial tests, we noticed the fleece sheds onto other layers of clothing.\n For those trekking in extreme weather conditions, the Patrol Pile Fleece Jacket offers all the comprehensive features you need. Part of Helly Hansen’s award-winning “Arctic Patrol” family (gear made for extreme-weather professionals), this jacket is suited for the worst weather. The adjustable hood and cuffs let you choose if you want the standard roomier openings or a tighter air-restricting fit. Thick YKK zippers on the shell and pockets are sturdy, great for extra assurance when you’re carrying valuables or going through uncertain terrain.\n\n When we tried this jacket, we felt like the insulation could handle most temperatures, but we’d definitely recommend an additional down jacket if you’ll be in freezing weather. We also loved how easy it was to wash — we didn’t put it through any special treatment (but did air-dry it), and it came out like new. There was some shedding after the first few washes, but this went away over the course of our five-month test. Helly Hansen is also a member of Bluesign, an organization that offers solutions and services to help companies become more sustainable.\n\n The Details: S to XXL | Polyester, polyamide, elastane | Full-zip\n\n We tested so many jackets that they couldn’t all make the list, and these four still have merit for some travelers despite small inconveniences.\n\n The North Face TKA Glacier 1/4 Zip Pullover: This pullover has soft, comfortable fleece and fits true to size. It doesn’t have pockets, which may be necessary depending on the activity.\n\n Columbia Sweater Weather Fleece Full Zip Jacket: This fleece feels high quality and has a competitive warmth-to-thickness ratio. That said, its breathability can cause wearers to get too warm depending on their activity.\n\n Parks Project Yellowstone Geysers Trail High Pile Fleece: This high-pile fleece offers an ultra-soft touch that maintains well after washing. We found the sizing to be off and a little too bulky.\n\n Patagonia Men’s Better Sweater 1/4 Zip Pullover: The true-to-size, fitted body maintained warmth when we wore it outside. With just one pocket on the chest, we wish it offered more storage.\n\n For this piece, the Travel + Leisure team tested 30 different jackets in everyday scenarios like exercise, running errands, and relaxing around the house. We used the same parameters for each jacket and judged them based on fit, design, performance, durability, and value. To test the overall breathability, we tried to blow air through the fleece fabric while holding our hand out on the other side to see how much air went through to our hand. We also washed the jackets to see if the process was convenient and easy and to see if the fleece fabric changed at all after. With fit, design, performance, durability, and value in mind, we selected the fleece jackets that performed the best all around in these categories. We will continue wearing these jackets for an additional six months to see if any of our opinions change over time.\n\n Not all fleece jackets work for every environment, so consider the weight of the fleece. If it’ll be colder, you’ll want a thicker, more durable jacket. If it’ll be warmer, you can stick with a lighter fleece. You also want to think about the activity you’ll be doing most of the time. If you’re going to be out for the whole day, you’ll want to have plenty of storage for keys, snacks, and other objects. If you’re just going out for a short job, you won’t need as many pockets.\n\n Corey Simpson, Communications Manager at Patagonia, recommends using the “80-20 rule” in which you should consider how you’ll use the jacket 80 percent of the time for primary use and 20 percent of the time for occasional activities. Then you should decide on the weight of the fleece (lightweight, midweight, or heavyweight) based on your intended use.\n\n If you plan to wear the jacket on its own, make sure it has enough thickness and durability to keep your body regulated in cooler temperatures. If you’re going to use the fleece as a base or midlayer, get a thinner fleece so you don’t overheat, but make sure you leave enough room to wear clothing underneath. Getting an in-between jacket that can have more or less layers will also help you perform the widest range of activities.\n\n Some fleece jackets we tested were made for specific use cases, and others were built for general purposes. Make sure that your budget and level of functionality match because if not, you’ll just end up paying for features you don’t need, or you may not get enough support.\n\n More technical fleeces may come at a higher price point for performance, Simpson says, so you can expect to pay more if you’re looking for something for a specific activity like skiing in cold weather, but it may not be as versatile for everyday use.\n\nIt depends on the brand, materials, and activity. Generally speaking, fleece jackets in the winter work best under a down coat or parka. If you’ll be running or exercising, then you can most likely get away with just a fleece jacket, but if you’ll be sitting outside for long periods of time, you’ll want to have some extra layering.\nYou should always check the care label on each garment, but most fleece jackets should be washed in cool-to-warm (stay away from hot) water with a mild detergent and set out to air-dry. If you have specific stains or spots you’re trying to remove, use an enzyme-based stain remover because it will break down stains better than just soap and water. Make sure to wash your jacket after every six to 10 wears to keep it clean, but also to not wear out the fabric from over washing. For fleeces that are susceptible to shedding, use a guppy bag or microfiber filter in the washing machine to prevent microfiber pollution.\n\nAnd remember that you’re going to want to keep your gear clean to keep it functioning well. “If you have a bunch of oils or if your fleece is saturated, you're not really getting the performance you need out of it,” Simpson says.\nWhile it varies by brand and level of quality, fleece typically does not shrink. If exposed to very high temperatures, fleece will shrink, but if you wash it properly with cooler water, it won’t. It’s always best to check the manufacturer’s care instructions.\n For this story, commerce writer Joe Niehaus sorted through T+L’s in-house testing data, then customer reviews and product descriptions to create an in-depth roundup of the best fleece jackets for men that are available today. He has tried many of the brands listed, including The North Face, Columbia, Patagonia, and Helly Hansen. T+L editors also consulted with Corey Simpson, Communications Manager at Patagonia for feedback on how to identify quality fleece and how to maintain a fleece jacket.\n\n Love a great deal?

Just look at the fleece-jacket market, which consists of not just classic Patagonia and North Face zip-ups, but in the last 15 years has grown to include versions by heritage menswear labels and reinterpreted by edgy designers. Now you can find these jackets in quilted fabrics, sheep’s and yak’s wool, in addition to the standard Polartec, as well as in more modern silhouettes and patterns.\nTo get an update on the coolest new fleeces, I asked more than a dozen stylish people about their favorite fleece jackets and the ones that they frequently recommend, from their everyday picks to splurge-worthy statement pieces.\n“I’m a bit of a purist when it comes to fleece, and my all-time favorite is the Patagonia Synchilla anorak in navy blue,” says brand consultant and stylist Laurel Pantin, who writes the shopping newsletter Earl Earl. “I like Patagonia’s company ethics, and I also like that this looks like what an ’80s Connecticut dad would wear — my aesthetic.”\nStyle blogger Bethany Everett-Ratcliffe likes this colorful snap-button pullover from Free People. “It’s most comparable to the brand’s older Nantucket Fleece, which I have and am still obsessed with,” she says. “While I don’t typically wear fleeces with jeans, it’s a great way to make jeans and a white tee look fun while keeping it casual.”\nStrategist junior writer Brenley Goertzen has worn this fleece for five years and says that it’s been great for Minnesota winters and cooler, transitional fall-to-spring weather. “In the winter, I wear it under my parka a lot when I want a fuzzy layer because it provides extra mid-weight warmth,” she says. “The collar is nice because it helps shield my neck from freezing gusts, plus the cuffs keep heat trapped inside really well. I also wear it without my parka when I’m lounging, running errands, or taking my pups for quick bathroom breaks.”\nThis recycled-polyester fleece is a favorite of Strategist senior editor Jen Trolio, who throws it on anytime she’s not wearing a puffer. She likes it with jeans and athleisure styles and for cooler weather. “I will wear it out more casually in the spring and fall but also for coaching soccer on the weekends or as an all-purpose jacket,” she says.\nOne of our favorite gifts for hikers, this fleece comes recommended by Strategist writer Kat Gillespie, who says its unique cut (which she describes as more of a ’70s look as opposed to a lot of other fleeces that reference the ’80s and ’90s) is rooted in versatility. “It’s designed for hiking/performance, but you could totally wear it in the city without anyone batting an eye,” she says. “The quilted fabric — rather than fuzzy — makes it feel a bit more formal and put together.”\nEverett-Ratcliffe calls this bomber “a chic cozy option,” noting how she reaches for her fleece “when going for my sad-girl walks, layered over a sweatshirt to keep warm.” She also likes to wear it when running quick errands and with leggings.\n“I’ve always admired this Snow Peak fleece,” says freelance fashion and culture writer Emilia Petrarca, who writes the shopping newsletter Shop Rat. “I think the lines are really flattering (fleeces can be too SpongeBob SquarePants for me sometimes). And I like that it keeps your hands warm. There are also big pockets in the back for carrying a book, or whatever, to the park.”\nThis reversible wool jacket is on Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo’s wish list. “I love soft fuzzy fleece but don’t love microplastics, and I run hot so synthetic fleece jackets make me sweat, while wool is breathable,” she says, adding that she likes wearing men’s clothing, and appreciates that it’s a unisex piece.\n“For a fancier fleece, I just got this one from Aztech Mountain, and it is so good,” says Pantin. “It’s solid black, so less gorpy, and looks great with a more polished skirt or pair of trousers. It’s kind of fashion-y — almost — but I’m also going to bring it skiing this spring.”\n“This fleece by Nanushka is my favorite of the season,” says stylist Kiarra Logan. “I love that it has a bandana-paisley-style pattern on top of a cool buttery yellow color.” Logan says that the fleece is a statement on its own, so she often styles it with a simple bottom combo of black sweats and Loewe Flow Runner sneakers.\nTimothy Grindle, co-founder of men’s clothing store Canoe Club, recommends this traditional L.L. Bean fleece with a more modern, boxy fit. “It has all the classic details in insanely good colorways,” he says. (While this is an only-in-Japan release, you can still order it for shipment to the U.S.)\nBenje Williams and Ken Bernard, co-founders of Brooklyn’s first dedicated hiking store, Outlandish, both recommend this ultrasoft crewneck fleece from Topo Designs. They like subtle details, like the “oh-so-necessary kangaroo pocket” and the thumbholes in the cuffs. Williams and Bernard add that the corded hem adds “a little extra swag to this boxy-cut piece.”\nBandit is known for making high-quality running apparel, and this jacket made from Portuguese wool is no exception. It’s much more breathable than it looks, which is great for runners who tend to overheat, like I do. Plus, it has a boxier, bomber-jacket silhouette that I like for casualwear.\nSome fleece designs look more like paintings on canvas, and this oversize option from Picture Organic has “a picturesque mountain scene that gives it a vintage appeal,” says men’s fashion director at Nordstrom Jian DeLeon.\nDeLeon calls the iconic Denali a “forever-relevant piece,” which he says can be zipped into a shell layer like the Mountain Jacket for extra protection against the weather. “Worn alone, it’s a great compromise of quality and classic style,” he says. “It’s great, but when zipped into the equally inimitable Gore-Tex shell, you end up with a modular piece you keep for life.” He also offers this pro tip: “The retro fit runs a bit baggier, which you absolutely want.”\nThe Woolly is made from a breathable yet supremely warm Polartec Alpha fabric, so it can be worn as a mid-layer under a shell on chillier days or by itself on warm days. Bernard says it’s “super lightweight” but excellent for wearing in a wide range of temperatures. The collar is thin and unobtrusive, which makes it easy to wear with other long-sleeved layers. Plus, William Ellery makes other versions with colorful, iridescent forearm patches.\nThis is my favorite fleece for winter running. Whenever it gets below 30 degrees, I throw this jacket on top of a base layer, and I’m perfectly insulated for long runs. It has multiple reverse panels (a fuzzy, high-pile polyester on one side, and a ribbed polyester on the other side) that keep my arms and torso from overheating. It’s also one of our favorite gifts for runners.\n“There’s nothing more influential than the first Patagonia fleece,” says Trevor Davis, the founder of outdoor brand William Ellery. “The shape of it, whether it be the three-button pullover or the full-zip chest pocket — that classic Patagonia style — that was the introduction to fleeces.”\nFrom its chopsticks to its stainless-steel camping mugs, Snow Peak makes high-quality gear. Leon Hedgepeth, an editor at the menswear newsletter Sprezza, says the brand’s clothes (like this fleece) are just as nice. “Everything design is functional since its an outdoor brand, but the fit and design are always spot on,” he says. “This fleece jacket is lightweight but lined with a thick Polartec fabric and front and back pockets for storage. If you’re looking for a mid-layering fleece to throw under a down jacket or topcoat, look no further.”\nFor a hooded option, DeLeon recommends this fleece hoodie, which he says has made a resurgence in recent collections. “Carhartt WIP’s version is based on its hard-wearing Active Jacket silhouette, reinterpreted in a colorful fleece with an artisanal touch,” he says.\nHedgepeth says that wearing the Mountain Gorilla fleece has a similar effect to wearing a vintage Patagonia fleece: “It feels like a winter jacket you can wear in 20-30-degree weather. The fleece is windproof, and the hemp cotton twill throughout the body and sleeves is substantial. I’ll happily be wearing this until April.”\n“Ralph Lauren always excels at injecting classic menswear with a modern novelty, and the label’s take on mixing a high-pile fleece with a dressier pattern like glen plaid elevates the casual silhouette,” DeLeon says.\n“I only wear fleece from Kapital,” says Strategist style columnist Chris Black, who recommends this polyester jacket with wavy stripes. “The prints and patterns are cool and a bit loud, but I can’t get enough.” Meanwhile, Grindle prefers the Boa Alpine fleece, which he calls a “sleeper piece” in the Kapital collection. He says the Alpine is a bit boxier, “So it feels modern and fresh, but nothing else about it is super wild, like a lot of Kapital pieces, so anybody can work it into their wardrobe.”\nGrindle says this hybrid snap-tee sweater is one of the most unique fleeces he owns. “It has a long staple fiber mohair, so it’s hairy (without being too hairy) and gives great texture and depth to a simple piece. It really shines as a mid-layer because you get that texture and the sophistication of a knit in the style of a casual fleece,” he says.\nGrindle says that while this high-pile yak-wool-blend jacket is pricey, it’s his most-worn fleece and his top recommendation. “These are made in super-limited quantities in Japan. It has this insanely beautiful texture and highs and lows in the fabric that are unmatched.” Grindle says that after years of wear, the Sunset Pile will show its wear “like a pair of jeans due to being hand-dyed with Sumi ink (soot dye) with accents in pure natural indigo. If there was one fleece to rule them all, in my opinion this is it,” he says.\n“One of the designer labels doing really interesting takes on the fleece is Angelo Urrutia of 4SDesigns,” says DeLeon. “Last season he introduced a patterned fleece with motifs commenting on immigration and reflecting on his Hispanic heritage. Couple that with a boxy, cropped fit, and interesting details like a two-way zip and a turquoise zipper pull, and it’s the kind of head-turning item that starts a conversation.”\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

He has worked for Wirecutter for a decade and lost count of the number of bags he has tested.\nAfter new testing, we have two new picks: the Hydro Flask 24 oz Wide Mouth with Flex Chug Cap and the Klean Kanteen 20 oz TKWide Insulated Water Bottle with Twist Cap.\nYou’re nothing without water.\nA reusable water bottle that is good-looking and functional is vital for anyone who wants to remain hydrated while reducing disposable-bottle waste.\nAfter putting in more than 150 hours of research—and testing more than 120 bottles—since 2014, we’ve chosen the five best water bottles in a range of materials and styles and for various situations.\nThey include our most versatile pick; a bottle with a straw, beloved for its functionality while you’re driving; a glass bottle, if you’re averse to plastic; and a bottle that protects against transferred flavors. We also have a list of plastic bottles we trust and some bottles that are decent for travel.\nToo small leaves you wanting more. Too large is heavy and unwieldy. A capacity of 20 to 24 ounces is just right.\nYou’ll be tossing your bottle in your tote bag or accidentally knocking it off your desk, so it should keep its contents inside.\nDo you enjoy drinking out of it when you’re walking? What about when you’re driving? Is it easy to hold in one hand?\nMost insulated bottles pass this test—but a few do not. (And glass bottles, not being insulated, don’t perform well in this regard at all.)\nAdvertisement\nWe created this guide in 2014, a decade ago. In that time we’ve tested some 120 bottles over many hundreds of hours of personal testing, panel testing, and research.\nFor this guide, we’ve done the following over the years:\nThese bottles are for anyone who’s thirsty.\nWater is a need that unites the world. So almost anyone should benefit from having a dependable water bottle that they love. Assuming that the bottle isn’t frequently lost and replaced, carrying a reusable water bottle is much better for the environment and way more cost-effective than buying bottled water.\nIn 2014 nearly 64% of all bottled water sold in the US was nothing more than pricey, prepackaged tap water (PDF). And that’s a trend that hasn’t declined (PDF) in the past decade.\nBottled water is a scam of convenience. Opt out of being a mark with a refillable bottle all your own.\nOn top of that, every day in the US, more than 60 million plastic bottles are thrown away—bottles that, in 2007, required somewhere between 32 million and 54 million barrels of oil, according to a study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters (PDF). That’s roughly 2,000 times as much as the energy cost of producing tap water.\nAny way you look at it, bottled water is a scam of convenience. Opt out of being a mark with a refillable bottle all your own.\nYou can get cleaner, better-tasting water with a filtered bottle that can travel with you—but other filtered water options may be more convenient overall.\nAdvertisement\nThis insulated steel bottle is pleasant to sip from and simple to carry, and it was completely leakproof in our tests.\nSize options (ounces): 24, 32, 40, 64Lids available: Flex Chug Cap (included), Flex Cap, Flex Sip Lid, Flex Straw CapDishwasher-safe: yes, but hand-washing is recommended\nReliable and versatile, the Hydro Flask 24 oz Wide Mouth with Flex Chug Cap is best for people who favor simple objects that do one thing well—whether you’re sitting at a desk, commuting on a subway, or working out at the gym.\nA Hydro Flask bottle—of any kind—is reliable. This insulated, double-walled stainless steel water bottle has a powder-coated exterior (a permanent, lightly textured coating) and a plastic cap. As with all our insulated picks, its steel core means that, unlike some aluminum competitors, this bottle won’t dent easily when dropped. Unlike glass bottles, this bottle won’t have issues with the bottom cracking. And unlike plastic bottles, it won’t deteriorate while in use. We’ve chosen Hydro Flask bottles for this guide since we first published it in 2014. Hydro Flask has had an excellent track record through our years of testing, and it backs its bottles with a limited lifetime warranty.\nThe cap fully covers the mouth of the bottle. Though we strongly recommend any variation of Hydro Flask’s bottle, we prefer the model with the Flex Chug Cap because, unlike the standard mouth design (our previous pick), it completely covers and protects the surface you put to your lips when you drink. You can use this bottle shape with three other lids, as well: the Flex Cap, the Flex Sip Lid (for hot drinks), and the Flex Straw Cap. We tested all of them, and they all work well, but we prefer the Flex Chug Cap for its simplicity and coverage. All Hydro Flask caps are also BPA-free.\nWider is better for most folks. A wide-mouthed bottle is easier to fill with water, either at a fountain or beneath a spout. We tested our preferred 24-ounce size, but this bottle comes in sizes all the way up to 64 ounces. No matter which size you choose, the wide mouth is easy to fill with ice of any size or shape, especially when the ice is ejected forcefully from a fridge dispenser.\nThe spout on this insulated bottle is easy to drink from and simpler to use than a sports cap, and the flip lid stays secure and out of your face. The bottle has a wide mouth, so you can effortlessly add ice and supplements.\n(available in orange)\nSize options (ounces): 18, 22, 24, 32, 40, 64Lids available: Spout Lid (included), Straw LidDishwasher-safe: yes, but hand-washing is recommended\nSecure and well made, with an included rubber base, the Takeya 24oz Actives Water Bottle with Spout Lid is great for anyone but best for the clumsy or forgetful.\nIt all starts with an excellent attached lid. This double-walled, stainless steel bottle is marketed to gym-goers. But even if you’re not seeking a water bottle for working out, the Takeya Actives bottle has a lid that’s a total standout. The plastic top features a spout with a twist-on flip cap. Spout lids flow as easily as if you were drinking from an open glass, yet they won’t splash you with the bottle’s contents as you’re cantering down the sidewalk or powering through a sweaty treadmill workout.\nThe spout lid on the Takeya Actives bottle stands out because you can lock it after you flip it open, so it doesn’t hit your face. And when it’s closed, it covers the drinking surface completely. Takeya also offers a Straw Lid, which you can purchase separately. We tested the Straw Lid, and it was leak-free; we recommend getting one if you primarily want to drink from this bottle while driving.\nIt’s wide enough for you to add ice or extras. The whole thing twists off to reveal a 2.25-inch-wide mouth opening, so you can add whatever you like—load the bottle with ice, add an electrolyte powder, plop in some lemon wedges. This diameter is pretty standard, though, across all the bottles we tested with wide-access caps, such as the Hydro Flask bottle.\nIt’s well protected from falls, and that feature doesn’t cost extra. A silicone rubber boot, or base, comes standard on this bottle and prevents it from slipping or making noise on hard surfaces. The bottle is also backed by a limited lifetime warranty. Takeya’s website lists the lid as being BPA-free, and it’s top-rack dishwasher-safe. But hand-washing is recommended for the body.\nIt’s well sized and leak-free. We originally tested this bottle in the 22-ounce size. Over the years—and maybe it’s just due to the average size of water bottles increasing in diameter—we’ve started to prefer the slightly larger 24-ounce size, which still fits in most cup holders and backpack pockets. Also, maybe we’re splitting hairs here, but something about that extra 2 ounces seems to mark the divide between a tease and a proper thirst-slaking amount of water. If you prefer, the bottle comes in both larger and smaller sizes, too, from 18 to 64 ounces. All of the Takeya bottle sizes we’ve tested have proved to be leak-free.\nAdvertisement\nIf you use a bottle with a straw, you don’t have to tilt your head back while drinking—it’s the easiest way to quaff water and keep your focus on the road. This bottle is also insulated and made by a certified B-Corp.\nSize options (ounces): 12, 16, 20, 32Lids available: TKWide Twist Cap (included), TKWide Chug Cap, TKWide Loop Cap, TKWide Café Cap, TKWide Straw CapDishwasher-safe: yes, but hand-washing is recommended\nIf you want a bottle that’s easy to open and simple to sip from, the Klean Kanteen 20 oz TKWide Insulated Water Bottle with Twist Cap is a great choice.\nIt has a great straw that’s easy to open. This bottle’s integrated silicone straw is set inside a twisting cap. When the cap is closed, the straw stays safely tucked away and protected from the elements, but a simple twist pops the straw out. (Inside the bottle, the silicone straw connects to a longer metal straw.) Closed, the cap is completely leak-free, making this bottle an ideal driving companion—it fits in a cup holder and is easy to sip from while you’re keeping your eyes on the road. Our testing panel also found the straw lid the easiest to access with a variety of dexterity limitations.\nIt’s easy to drink from. If you have daily hydration goals, there’s something about a straw that makes it easy to consume the 20, 30, or 40 ounces of water you have ahead of you. We tested this bottle in the 20-ounce size, which was the closest to our preferred 24 ounces, but this Klean Kanteen bottle also comes in both larger and smaller sizes. We also liked the 32-ounce size, which would be easy to fill once (or twice) and to position next to your laptop, where you could easily grab it and hit your goal for the day.\nIt has decent alternative lids. You can swap out the lid for four others from Klean Kanteen: the TKWide Chug Cap, TKWide Loop Cap, TKWide Café Cap, and TKWide Straw Cap. We found the Loop Cap to be a decent alternative if you want a standard water bottle, and the Chug Cap could easily make this Klean Kanteen model a runner-up to our pick from Takeya. But we were a little less impressed with the Café Cap and the Straw Cap, both of which leaked at times.\nIt comes with a mission. Klean Kanteen offers a lifetime limited warranty against defects in the manufacturing and materials; the company will replace defective items. And Klean Kanteen is a B-Corp with Climate Neutral Certification (though we remain skeptical as to whether that neutrality is based on carbon offsets). The company is also a member of the 1% for the Planet pledge, with a general mission to increase sustainability in the world.\nThis is the only glass bottle we’ve found in which no plastic touches your water, and the bottle itself is housed in a protective silicone sleeve. But it can’t keep your water cold for long.\nSize options (ounces): 12, 22, 32, 40Lids available: stainless-steel-lined lid (included)Dishwasher-safe: yes\nIf you’d rather not drink out of metal or plastic, or if you simply enjoy the heft and presence of a glass bottle, the Purifyou Glass Water Bottle is a lovely choice.\nIt’s a glass bottle that doesn’t cut corners. We recognize that some people just don’t want plastic touching their water. A major reason this bottle outperformed all the other glass options is that it’s the only one we found with a metal-lined cap rather than some form of plastic. The simple utility of a finger loop on the cap was a pleasant surprise—it made the repetitive task of opening and closing the cap that much easier, compared with standard round caps.\nThe narrow lip is better for some people. We also like the small mouth on this bottle, specifically. When you drink from a wide-mouth glass bottle, it can seem as if you’re drinking out of a jar. The downside is that the Purifyou bottle—unlike our insulated picks—is too narrow to accommodate ice cubes. But a glass bottle can’t retain heat or cold anyway, so that isn’t really a problem. We tested and liked the dimensions of the 22-ounce bottle, though it won’t fit in many cup holders since the base is 3.25 inches wide. The body’s center is a little wide too, and it isn’t tapered like some others, but we had no problem holding it.\nIt’s glass, but not just any glass. The Purifyou bottle is made of borosilicate glass, and that makes it special. Borosilicate glass resists thermal shock, so if you take the bottle out of a hot dishwasher and fill it with cold or room-temperature water, it will resist shattering better than bottles made of common soda-lime glass. In addition, its integrated silicone sleeve helps to guard against the occasional bump (although it won’t stand up to being repeatedly dropped like our steel-core picks). Purifyou offers warranty coverage for all manufacturing defects and will replace the bottle if it “breaks within the first year” if you register online.\nAdvertisement\nThis sleek-looking bottle has an unbreakable glass interior that prevents flavors from transferring. We also like it for both hot and cold drinks, as—unlike a glass bottle—it insulates well.\nWith store pickup or REI membership\nSize options (ounces): 10 (Maker), 18 (Mover), 32 (Founder)Lids available: Element Top (twist lid), Union Top (spout lid), Scope Top (café lid)Dishwasher-safe: no\nIf you notice that odors or flavors in your old water bottle don’t go away, if you want a bottle that looks like a design object, or if you want one bottle that can hold both hot and cold drinks, the Purist Mover 18oz is the perfect choice.\nIt’s great if you like ice water one day and hot coffee the next. The 18-ounce Purist Mover is a drink bottle designed within an inch of its life. While its exterior is stainless steel, its interior is glass. Unlike traditional glass vacuum linings, the Purist Mover’s is unbreakable (and so minimal that you can barely notice it) because it’s applied as a thin, spray-on coating. You get the benefits of a glass bottle minus the weight and potential breakage, plus it keeps drinks hot or cold. In our tests, this bottle was as tough as our non-glass picks, yet we didn’t experience any taste-transfer issues as we occasionally did with stainless steel and plastic models.\nIt lasts for years. We’ve had this bottle in testing for five years, including one episode where we left it under a car seat for a month with kombucha in it. Someone finally got the courage to open the bottle and clean it out, and the next day a bottle full of water tasted like water and nothing else. Wirecutter’s Tim Barribeau—who is pathologically averse to the taste of coffee—found that even after cold-brew concentrate sat in the Purist Mover for a weekend, water came out tasting fresh after a simple wash of the bottle. Some tastes and smells lingered in the flip-top lid, but those disappeared after a good scrub. Purist offers a two-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects.\nIt’s customizable. Purist offers three lids that work with this water bottle: the simple, screw-top Element Top, the flip-spout Union Top, and the Scope Top, a café lid designed for hot beverages. The lip of the bottle is somewhat thick, so if drinking from a thick-walled bottle would bother you, we recommend either the Union Top or the Scope Top. Though 18-ounce bottles can feel small, the Mover can hold more than advertised. The Union Top spout cap is hollow and raised above the top of the bottle, in contrast with the flat Element Top, which plunges downward. As a result, using the Union Top, you can fill the bottle to the brim; we did, and that’s when we discovered that the bottle can hold up to 21 ounces. Purist also sells bottles in smaller and larger sizes, up to 32 ounces.\nPurist has a lifetime warranty that covers manufacturing defects.\nIf you want more size options: Consider the Yeti Rambler 26 oz Water Bottle. We decided not to make it a pick because of its high cost per ounce compared with the Hydro Flask bottle. But it comes in a larger variety of sizes—18, 26, 36, 46, and 64 ounces—and has a similar well-protected drinking spout.\nIf you’re traveling by air: Consider the Slim Stainless Steel Memobottle, which is uniquely shaped—long and slender, like a pencil case—to take up less room in your personal-item bag than a traditional water bottle. However, it’s expensive and not great for general use: The bottle’s contoured bottom prevents it from standing on its own, and it certainly won’t sit snugly in a standard cup holder.\nIf you’re set on getting a collapsible travel bottle: Consider the Nomader Collapsible Water Bottle, which was our travel pick in 2018. It has stood the test of time, whereas other travel bottles have sprung leaks. If you must have a travel bottle, this one is the easiest to fill and drink from. Our big concern is that this bottle doesn’t roll down particularly small, so it’s up to you to decide whether the tiny space savings are worth paying for.\nIf you want a classic plastic bottle: Consider the Nalgene Wide Mouth Sustain Water Bottle, which is inexpensive, indestructible, and lightweight. For a decade now, we’ve been talking about why this bottle isn’t one of our picks. In day-to-day life, it’s sort of annoying. You can’t drink out of it while walking, its attached cap gets in your face, and it doesn’t fit in a cup holder or a backpack pocket. Out there in the wild, it’s the ultimate weapon. Back here in the urban jungle, it’s just kind of a klutz.\nIf you want a spout lid on a lightweight, plastic bottle: After a reimagining of the lid on the CamelBak Chute Mag 25oz Bottle—resulting in the addition of a magnet to keep the lid open and out of the way while you’re drinking—we can’t find any serious negatives for this bottle, other than its plastic construction. If you’re okay with that, you may like this bottle.\nAdvertisement\nThe Owala FreeSip has a remarkable online following, maybe not quite as large but certainly just as fervent as that of the Stanley Quencher. When we started testing it, it became clear why people love this bottle so much: It’s inexpensive, easy to use with one hand while you’re driving, and adaptable. Throw in unusual color palettes and limited-edition releases, and you have quite the formula for online success. Our only hesitation is the lightweight spring release of the cap, which we fear may break over time. We hear you, Owala fans, but we’re not ready to recommend this bottle without further long-term stress testing—which we’re doing right now.\nThere are so many water bottles in the world that it’s helpful for us to outline what we don’t consider, as well as what we do. Some vessels could easily serve as water bottles, but because of their included caps (travel-mug caps) or their available sizes (limited to smaller capacities), they are more suited to hot drinks. If that’s what you’re looking for, we have a guide to travel mugs for hot beverages.\nIn evaluating water bottles, we look for the following:\nOnce we found the water bottles that met the above criteria, we put them to the test. We performed our leak and temperature tests to compare the bottles, but we also subjected them to daily use at the gym, at the office, and at home, on airplanes, in cars, and on walks, and anywhere else we might find ourselves thirsty.\nAdvertisement\nColeman FreeFlow Autoseal 40 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle: We passed on this bottle for the same reason we pass on most trigger bottles—it has a relatively elaborate cap that needs detailed cleaning.\nCorkcicle Classic Canteen: This bottle performed well in every regard, but its cap is the smallest of those on the various bottles we tested. In fact, the cap was so small, we were afraid we’d lose it.\nCorkcicle Series A Sport Canteen: This bottle performed poorly in our insulation tests. Also, though it didn’t leak during testing, we thought the quick-sip lid was too prone to human error to be genuinely leakproof.\nHealthy Human 21oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle: Several of these bottles leaked in our testing.\nKlean Kanteen Classic Water Bottle with Sport Cap: This bottle has had small leaks throughout our years of testing. That history was the source of our biggest hesitation about recommending the Klean Kanteen TKWide with the Twist Cap, but the TKWide’s straw design, ease of use, and overall praise from our testing panel nudged it into the mix—for now.\nKlean Kanteen Classic Insulated Bottle with Pour Through Cap: Though the new lid’s dual gaskets fixed the bottle’s leaking problem, opening the pour-through cap took us twice as many turns in comparison with most other bottles. This bottle works better for carrying hot drinks to pour into a smaller cup. Plus, the cap is metal, as is the bottle, and everyone who tested this model hated the metal-on-metal sound of the cap threading onto the bottle.\nSimple Modern Summit Water Bottle 32 oz: This bottle leaked through the threads when we left it on its side overnight.\nStanley Quik Flip Go Bottle: This is one of the few flip-top bottles we’ve found that have a lock to secure the top. But this bottle is especially tall and unwieldy. It would make a better thermos than a water bottle.\nS’well Original Bottle: This bottle insulates as well as our insulated picks, and it has been watertight in all our tests. If you like it, go for it. Keep in mind, though, that S’well bottles, unless they’re on sale, are more expensive at every capacity than almost anything else we’ve seen.\nEllo Syndicate 20 oz Glass Water Bottle: This bottle has a cap problem, with reports of mold building up.\nGlasstic 16oz Clear Glass: This bottle suffered from extensive scuffing during our drop tests.\nLifefactory 22 oz Glass Water Bottle: The wide mouth was awkward to drink out of—it felt like drinking out of a jar. Also, the standard lid is watertight but made of plastic, a concern for many people seeking glass bottles.\nHydaway Collapsible Water Bottle: This model was a pick years ago, but we received feedback both from people who loved it and from others who hated it. Such mixed reports convinced us that this bottle wasn’t a reliable recommendation for most travelers.\nVapur 1L Wide Mouth Anti-Bottle: The cap leaked when we applied lateral torsion.\nCamelBak Podium 21oz Bike Bottle: A former pick, this lightweight squeeze bottle is cheap enough that if the TSA agent makes you ditch it at the airport, you won’t be heartbroken. But the CamelBak Chute is a little more practical for most people.\nTakeya 24oz Tritan Water Bottle: This is a version of our attached-cap pick made from a BPA-free Tritan. It offers all of the same attributes as our pick but in a lightweight and non-insulated plastic. We dismissed it because a plastic bottle shouldn’t cost as much as this one does.\nYeti Yonder 34 oz Water Bottle: This is a plastic version of the Yeti Rambler, our insulated alternative to our top pick. But you pay extra for the name; plastic bottles everywhere else are far less expensive.\nIf you’re drinking anything besides water, gunk will build up in your bottle over time, so you’ll need to clean it occasionally. The best way to do that is to use a bottle brush and some baking soda and vinegar.\nThis bottle-cleaning set includes a skinny straw brush and a looped, detail-cleaning brush—everything you need to keep your water bottle squeaky-clean.\nAfter several hours of research, we found that the best bottle-cleaning set is the OXO Good Grips Water Bottle Cleaning Set. This dishwasher-safe kit offers a large bottle brush, a skinny straw brush, and a looped, detail-cleaning brush, all kept together on a handy ring so you don’t lose any parts. We bought a couple of sets to confirm their quality, and they are as good as we thought they would be.\nThis article was edited by Ria Misra and Christine Ryan.\nAdvertisement\nKit Dillon\nKit Dillon is a senior staff writer at Wirecutter.

I carry it around the house all day, leave it by my bedside at night, and take it with me pretty much whenever I go on errands, walks, and trips. Before I found my ideal water bottle, though, I cycled through quite a few that ended up unused (too big to be practical for my lifestyle, didn’t keep water cold enough when I was out all day, or made me worried about spilling in my tote). What elevates a water bottle from just an okay water bottle to an excellent one is, first and foremost, whether it does a good job keeping your water cold. Then, I think it’s important that a water bottle be adaptable — that it can conform to your needs throughout the day, or week, whether you want to bring it to work, take it on a hike, or just casually tote it around the house with you.\nFortunately, there is no shortage of options for every type of water drinker: vacuum-sealed mugs for summertime road-trippers, squeezable bottles for runners training for a marathon, and gallon-size vessels for those who hate to refill. To figure out the best water bottles out there, I spoke to more than 20 people across the food, fitness, and sustainability spaces about the bottle they feel most passionate about, from the dentproof Yeti that’s ideal for children to the plastic cycling bottle that tastes “like you’re drinking right out of a glass.” Then, over the course of several months, I got to testing: on sweltering days, long car rides, and commuting around the city, swapping out my Hydro Flask (my personal favorite and our best overall pick) for hours or days at a time to see how they stacked up. And if you’re looking for the best reusable travel mugs to take hot beverages on the go, we’ve got you covered there, too.\nUpdate on September 10, 2024: Updated prices and checked stock for all products.\nMost of the bottles on this list come in multiple sizes that hold varying amounts of water. If that’s the case, I’ve given details accordingly. Logically, if you’re going to be toting your water bottle around all day with nowhere to refill it, you’ll want something bigger. If you only plan on using it for a few hours, you should be fine with something smaller.\nThe type of lid on your reusable water bottle will make a difference in how you experience drinking from it. Some have bigger mouths, some smaller. Some lids fully detach, while others twist off but stay attached. Some flip open and lock shut; others have a “sport” cap from which you can suck out the water. What you choose will depend on what you find comfortable to drink from, as well as what you’ll be doing as you sip, swig, or chug (sitting at a desk, exercising, running errands, driving or whatever else). It’s also worth noting that many of the brands below sell various types of compatible lids beyond what the listed bottle comes with. Again, if that’s the case, I’ve noted so in the description.\nSome bottles on this list are insulated stainless steel that keeps your water very cold for long periods of time. But others are plastic, glass, or non-insulated steel, as several of the people I spoke with prefer room-temperature water (or at least don’t mind when the liquid doesn’t stay cold all day).\nVolume: Multiple sizes, 18 ounces to 40 ounces | Lid type: Detached screw top | Material: Insulated stainless steel\nI’m a Hydro Flask devotee. I’ve owned my 24-ounce bottle for four years now and it’s in as-good shape as when I bought it. The stainless steel insulated interior keeps water cold for hours at a time (though I usually go through it faster than that, I’ve savored it over long car rides and afternoons walking around in the hot sun with no perceptible temperature drop). Mine has a straw lid (which you can purchase from the get-go, or separately if you want both options). It’s a feature that has made me drink far more water than I did before. Because there’s nothing to unscrew unless it needs a refill, I tote it around the house all day and night long, constantly sipping with ease. And the straw clicks securely down so there’s no leaking when I throw it in a tote bag. As for maintenance, I throw both pieces in the dishwasher every couple of weeks and give the straw an extra scrub with a long and narrow brush like this one. Basically, it hits the mark in every way: great temperature retention, a leak-proof cap, a durable body, and sleek form.\nSeveral folks I talked to — not to mention many members of Strategist’s own team — love their Hydro Flasks, too. LaToya Tucciarone, founder of SustainAble Home Goods in Atlanta, and her family have been using various models for many years — “five years, maybe ten, I can’t even remember,” she says, “but they’re not degraded at all.”\nBettina Stern and Juan Dromogoole, respectively founder of and director of operations at Chaia in Washington D.C., are most hyped on Hydro Flask’s insulation ability. “If I’m going on a run, or a bike ride, I will take my Hydro Flask, which fits into my cup holder in my car, and I’ll fill it with cold water,” says Stern. “ And then when I finish, I have something to come back to. It’s just as cold as when I left it.” Journalist and cookbook author Lesley Téllez also swears by the brand, noting that it’s not too heavy to carry around all day.\nWhile we’ve listed our favorite bottles for outdoor activities like hiking and backpacking below, Strategist writer Jeremy Rellosa has used this lightweight Hydro Flask on the trail before and says it’s a good option for someone who prioritizes cold water on the go. “I value weight and volume more, but for those who want the insulation, I’d point them to this,” he says.\nVolume: 17 ounces each | Lid type: Fliplock lid | Material: Insulated stainless steel\nFor the same price of the smallest 18-ounce Hydro Flask, ThermoFlask sells this set of two 17-ounce bottles with the same double-wall insulating technology (as well as a notably similar design and name). I put my own Hydro Flask to the side to test it. The flip-up mechanism is similar to my Hydro Flask, but instead of a straw, it reveals a wider opening. Not only do I generally prefer that to the caps you have to fully unscrew to drink from, but I found that sipping was easy and tidy thanks to a U-shaped enclosure around the hole that guided a steady stream of water out of the bottle and into my mouth. I also appreciate the handle, which made the bottle comfortable to carry around on walks when I didn’t bring a bag with me. The size is smaller than my Hydro Flask, which means I didn’t take it with me when I was planning to be out for more than an hour or so, but it’s a bit lighter-weight.\nThe set was recommended by cookbook author and recipe developer Lukas Volger, who appreciates that they “don’t have tons of tiny crevices in the cap that make them impossible to ever get properly clean,” he says. He also likes that the lid can be opened and closed with one hand, which helps while exercising and in the car. I found the lid convenient, too, even while doing nothing but sitting around.\nVolume: Multiple sizes, 16 ounces to 48 ounces | Lid type: Attached screw top | Material: Plastic\nFirst popularized by hikers during the environmental movement of the 1970s, Nalgene’s plastic bottles enjoy cult status today among mountain climbers and podcast merch designers alike. This bottle, made from HDPE plastic, is even lighter than the brand’s regular bottles. It weighs a mere 3.75 ounces when empty, whereas classic Tritan plastic Nalgenes come in at 6.25 ounces, which can make a difference when you’re toting a full bottle around all day or going hiking. Recipe developer and cookbook author Jessie Sheehan loves that its massive 32-ounce size “holds a lot of water, which is helpful for those of us obsessed with drinking eight glasses a day,” but that the HDPE construction means it’s “still so lightweight.” And Emily Fiffer, co-owner of Botanica in Los Angeles — who refills hers multiple times a day — says the water never tastes plasticky, the lid doesn’t leak, and “it literally just can’t break” no matter how many times you drop it.\nVolume: Multiple sizes, 12 ounces to 20 ounces | Lid type: Fliplock lid | Material: Insulated stainless steel\nZojirushi’s insulated bottle has the build locked in. To start, water stays cold all day long thanks to an insulated steel layer between the inside and outside of the bottle. I took mine on a recent cross-country trip, filled it with ice and water at the airport, and found it in the exact same state by the time I landed and got where I was going. Cookbook author and recipe developer Carla Lalli Music, who swears by hers, had a similar experience on a blazing hot day at the beach. “It was literally anchored in the sand, in full sunlight,” she says. “At the end, there were still cubes inside,” she says. “You don’t have to keep it in a cooler. It is a cooler.” New York deputy editor Alexis Swerdloff also loves it, calling its stay-cold capabilities “mind-boggling.” (For comparison sake, my Hydro Flask will certainly keep water cold for hours on end, but won’t retain solid cubes.)\nMusic also praises Zojirushi’s vacuum-sealing lid, calling it “the most bust-proof cap in the biz.” In my own testing, I found this to be true as well. I even purposely held it fully upside down and jostled it all around with no spilling. The cap clicks closed and you have to press in to release it, so it never accidentally flips open and leaks. And while I overall prefer drinking from a straw, the flow of water out of the open mouth piece is quite comfortable and controlled.\nVolume: 12 ounces | Lid type: Straw cap | Material: Insulated stainless steel\nThe best water bottle for kids needs to be able to withstand some rough and tumble. Cookbook author Erin Gleeson says that while her three kids have been especially “hard on water bottles” in the past, none of them have yet been able to make a dent in these “tough” bottles from Yeti. Not only is the brand’s thick, steel construction incredibly drop-resistant, but this design also has a handle for little ones to grip, and, at 12 ounces, is slightly smaller and more manageable than your typical adult-sized bottle, which come in five sizes from 18 to 64 ounces. (Gleeson also says the smooth, stainless-steel interior keeps them “not grimy,” and appreciates that both the lid and bottle are dishwasher-safe.)\nVolume: 12 ounces | Lid type: Straw cap | Material: Insulated stainless steel\nStrategist senior editor Jen Trolio used the 12-ounce Funtainer for both her kids for over a year (the older one, now 9, has since graduated to a Hydro Flask, and the younger one uses a larger 16-ounce Funtainer at school). “They aren’t going to hold ice for 24 hours or anything, but they are insulated, non-sweating, and very solid on keeping water cold for at least a few hours,” she says. She also appreciates that they fit securely in backpack side pockets and have a silicone handle for comfortable carrying and a ring around the bottom in the same material to help prevent scratches and nicks. “I’m shocked that they [didn’t get] way more dented given how [the kids] threw the things around,” she says. And then, there’s the fact that they come in a myriad of fun colors and prints (both licensed, like Pokémon, and generic, like a rainbow design).\nVolume: Multiple sizes, 12 ounces to 27 ounces | Lid type: Sport cap | Material: Stainless steel\nKlean Kanteen makes bottles in three different sizes — the 18 ounces listed above, a bigger 27 ounces, and a child’s-size 12 ounces — with universal-size lids that can easily be mixed and matched. “My family has about a dozen of them,” says Mei Li, co-owner of Mei Mei in Boston and writer of Food Waste Feast. “They come in lots of colors (important when you have opinionated children) and are super easy to clean. I appreciate that they don’t have tons of fussy little bits that are easy to lose and that the same tops fit all of them so I don’t have to keep track. It allows you to switch in between super easily.” There are also several different styles of lids, so you can buy a handful of them and pick out whichever one you need for whichever bottle you or any other member of your family might want at any given time — say, a sippy cap for a younger child and a loop cap for an older one. Li also notes that the bottles keep water fairly cold for a while, but not all-day ice cold.\nVolume: One gallon | Lid type: Attached screw top | Material: Plastic\nThis gallon-size motivational water bottle first came across my radar in 2019. It was recommended by Caroline Goldfarb in a review for the Strategist, who says it became her emotional-support water bottle before that was a thing: “The jug is my best friend, my personal trainer, my mean Persian mom, my fears, my desires, all melted into one BPA-free bottle.”\nIt was a “day-five pandemic purchase” for content creator and recipe developer Dan Pelosi, who was looking for an easier way to drink a lot of water every day. (The vessel has personal-trainer-style phrases down on the side that encourage you to drink to the next line down every two hours, which Pelosi says kept him “laughing, and peeing, too.”) Years later, he’s as much a fan of the bottle’s design quality as he is of its sense of humor: “It’s so thick and wide that you can’t knock it over,” he says, adding that the spout closes with an “audible click that really works.” Indeed, while you can find variations of this design online, this one has a convenient straw spout that makes it extra easy to drink from. The lid also has a very tight seal. “I would turn it sideways and do dumbbell curls and it was fine — no spilling,” Pelosi says. And Goldfarb thinks there are other benefits to drinking that much water: “When I consistently drink a gallon a day, I find my skin is clearer, my bloat is down, and (perhaps best of all) I don’t feel as gross after a night of drinking booze.”\nVolume: 22 ounces | Lid type: Straw cap | Material: Plastic\nRellosa has backpacked everywhere from Patagonia to Nepal and swears by his LifeStraw to keep him hydrated. He can fill it up from any stream or pond and the filter inside cleans out pollutants. He says it’s also more efficient than gravity filters that are better suited for camping, and lighter weight than large filtration apparatuses. “And though you can pop iodine tablets in your bottle to purify the water, they won’t filter out debris like this will,” he says.\nVolume: 12 ounces and 18 ounces | Lid type: Push/pull lid | Material: Insulated plastic\nA water bottle for running needs to be comfortable to hold and not too heavy when full. Philip Speer, co-owner and chef of Comedor in Austin, (an avid runner, he’s participated in ultramarathons, and even started a run club with his restaurant colleagues that meets multiple times a week), turns to the ingeniously-designed, insulated Nathan QuickSqueeze to stay hydrated on any runs longer than a 5k. It comes with a “super comfortable” attached strap that secures around your hand — to use it, Speer says you just “lift your hand up to your face, bite down around the top, squeeze it, then put your hand back down.” Helpfully, the strap includes a zip pocket for keys and credit cards, and even an elastic pocket for a smartphone – though you’ll want to size up to the $40 18-ounce edition for any larger devices.\nVolume: 22 ounces | Lid type: Watergate cap | Material: Insulated plastic\nIf you’re serious about cycling, consider this bottle from Specialized. With lightweight, simple cap options that are all catered toward easy maneuvering, and the right silhouette to click into bicycle cages, they’re specifically designed for drinking while riding. “The Purist bottle, made from insulated plastic like the Nathan above, is widely regarded as the default cycling bottle by most shops,” says Eighth Hour Bike Studio owner Ronnie Garcia, adding that you’ll find customized versions at almost every bike retailer. But Garcia also appreciates the quality of the insulated plastic: “Cheaper bottles will start to deform and end up not fitting so well,” he says. Brooklyn Bicycle Co. president Ryan Zagata notes that the material doesn’t leach out any unpleasant taste, another issue with cheaper plastic models. “It tastes like you’re drinking right out of a glass,” he says.\nVolume: Multiple sizes, 14 ounces to 40 ounces | Lid type: Straw cap | Material: Insulated stainless steel\nThe Stanley has been something of a social-media phenomenon for a while now. It went viral last year and is still hanging on some corners of Instagram and TikTok. (It also spawned many imitations from other water-bottle brands.) But it’s not just a trend.\nStrategist writer Arielle Avila has owned the 40-ounce for many months now and swears she drinks more water than when she used a Nalgene. This is, she says, thanks to the straw. Because there’s nothing to unscrew, she sips from it even when she’s not actively thinking about how she should be hydrating. She also appreciates how the large handle makes it easier to carry around, especially for such a large vessel, and the fact that it keeps water cold all day long. She does warn that it’s big and fairly heavy when full, so she drinks from it mostly at home and at the gym in her building. (The Stanley does have an option to sip from a slightly larger open hole, but Avila rarely uses it because the bottle is a bit heavy to tilt back comfortably, she says.)\nAnd even Nicola Peltz Beckham — who claims she was “never a person who brought water bottles around with me” — told us the Stanley has converted her. “My mom sent me one, and I absolutely made fun of her. I was like, ‘I’m never going to bring that thing anywhere with me. That’s so embarrassing.’ Now, I’m that person who can’t go anywhere without it.” Hannah Brown, another celebrity who included the bottle on their list of favorite things, admits, “it’s such a basic-girl thing, but they’re great and fit in the cup holder. I love being able to hold the handle. What’s not to love? There’s a reason everybody’s obsessed with them.”\nVolume: Multiple sizes, 24 ounces to 40 ounces | Lid type: Straw and sip lid | Material: Insulated stainless steel\nThe Owala also had a big moment. Although it was perhaps a bit less online than the Stanley, I wrote about how it was the status water bottle last year — and I think it’s here to stay. Anecdotally, I see it out in the world frequently (at the grocery store, at the gym, on the street). But it’s not just that: Eleven Strategist staffers (as well as Lance Bass and Samantha Irby) are enthusiastic owners.\nAfter testing it myself, I get the hype: There are two options for sipping. One opening allows you to suck water through a straw, while the other reveals a wide-mouth hole with a protruding angled border to help guide a stream of water for gulps. (This is unlike my Hydro Flask, which has a straw lid you have to unscrew completely if you want to reveal the wider opening, and the Stanley, which has a separate straw you have to put in and take out of a designated hole, and is a bit more cumbersome overall.) Its cold retention is great. I took it to the park for several hours filled with ice on a recent hot afternoon, and the cubes stayed solid the whole time. I carried it there in a tote bag, too, with no leaking.\nStrategist junior writer Brenley Goertzen bought an Owala last summer and, after using around ten other models in the years before, has become a total convert. She uses the straw most of the time because it allows her to sip thoughtlessly — so much so that she says she’s more than tripled her daily fluid intake. But she says she likes the big opening for really chugging after running without having to worry about “accidentally pouring water down my shirt, which happened all the time with my Hydro,” she says. (I’ll concede that this is fair: The Owala’s bigger opening is smoother than the Hydro Flask’s.) Strategist senior editor Winnie Yang also points out that the sip hole allows her to get the last bit of water out once she reaches the bottom and the straw isn’t able to draw any more out. And Strategist senior editor Jen Trolio says she finds the straw mechanism itself is much more pleasant to drink from than ones that stick out.\nOne note: Trolio also mentioned that the lid lock on her bottle has now broken twice, and she had a not-great customer-service experience when it came to replacing the part (which is often sold out online). No other Strategist staffers have experienced this, but it feels worth a warning.\nVolume: 17 ounces | Lid type: Detached screw top | Material: Stainless steel\nLund’s water bottles are distinctive: I love their playful frames and pretty colors. But according to Strategist writer and self-proclaimed “hydrating freak” Ambar Pardilla, the charming look of this bottle doesn’t mean it lacks in practicality: The lid screws on tight and the water stays cold, she assures. She points out the aesthetic is, in a certain way, the opposite of the bulkier Nalgenes and Hydro Flasks. “I loved the design immediately when I saw it,” she says. “It looks like one of those silly little sculptures you’d use to beef up a toddler’s bookcase. And the color combinations are so wacky — they shouldn’t work together, but they somehow do. It makes me happy whenever I drink from it.”\nVolume: 17 ounces | Lid type: Detached screw top | Material: Glass\nOn the other end of the spectrum, I find this Japanese-designed Kinto bottle to be satisfyingly understated. It comes recommended by Downtime founder Alishia Ramos, who bought it because of “the design, first and foremost,” she says. “It’s eye-catching even though it’s minimalist.” It’s made from copolyester, a thermoplastic resin that has the appearance of glass, but is much more durable and lightweight. “I really like the way my hands can fit around the profile of the bottle,” says Ramos. “It’s a little skinnier than a lot of others, and I never have to worry about it fitting in a cup holder or my purse.” One more plus? “There’s no obvious branding. It says ‘Kinto’ on the bottom, but you can’t really see it.”\n• Arielle Avila, Strategist writer• Juan Dromgoole, director of operations at Chaia• Emily Fiffer, co-owner of Botanica• Ronnie Garcia, owner of Eighth Hour Bike Studio• Erin Gleeson, cookbook author• Brenley Goertzen, Strategist junior writer• Carla Lalli Music, cookbook author and recipe developer• Mei Lei, co-owner of Mei Mei and writer of Food Waste Feast• Ambar Pardilla, Strategist writer• Dan Pelosi, recipe developer and content creator of GrossyPelosi• Alishia Ramos, founder of Downtime• Jeremy Rellosa, Strategist writer• Jessie Sheehan, cookbook author and recipe developer• Philip Speer, co-owner and chef of Comedor• Bettina Stern, founder of Chaia• Alexis Swerdloff, New York deputy editor• Lesley Téllez, journalist and cookbook author• Jen Trolio, Strategist senior editor• LaToya Tucciarone, founder of SustainAble Home Goods• Winnie Yang, Strategist senior editor• Lukas Volger, cookbook author and recipe developer• Ryan Zagata, president of Brooklyn Bicycle Co.\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

As someone who likes the idea of drinking water but can’t seem to stick to the whole eight-glasses-a-day routine, I’ve tried a lot of water bottles. I still have an ancient sticker-covered Nalgene that I keep purely for sentimental purposes, giant water bottles for road trips and day hikes, stainless steel water bottles for insulation, and glass water bottles for when I want to feel fancy. Some of them have actually helped me stay more hydrated, while others just live rent-free in the cabinet above my stove that only gets opened once a year. If you’re looking for a new water bottle to meet your 2024 hydration goals, here are some of BA’s editor-approved picks.\nWhile the Stanley cup craze might never truly end, we’d like to offer this alternative: the Owala Freesip. BA writer Ali Francis, and many other staffers, are deeply obsessed with this water bottle. The 32-ounce insulated bottle has a leak-proof cap and a convertible mouthpiece that works for straw enthusiasts and people who like to chug their beverages. Plus, it is inarguably the coolest-looking water bottle on this list, and maybe the planet.\n\nOwala FreeSip Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle\nAmazon\nEveryone has one water bottle they reach for again and again purely for emotional support purposes, and mine is this 32-ounce stainless steel bottle from Mermaid Straw. I generally prefer water bottles with straw lids, and this one is both easy to sip from and easy to clean. My favorite thing, though, is the handle, because it means I can easily clip this to a tote bag with a carabiner, but I can also just hold it like a little hydration accessory. The vacuum insulated design also keeps water cold for over 24 hours.\n\nMermaid Straw 32-Ounce Stainless Steel Reusable Bottle\nAmazon\nThis is the water bottle I tend to keep out on my desk when I know I need to drink more water, and it’s also the one I bring with me on long trips. It’s made from lightweight, BPA-free plastic, and it comes with a silicone sleeve to prevent condensation. There’s also a fabric loop for easy carrying, a straw lid, and a fruit infusion strainer in case you want to make your water less boring with things like lemon slices and fresh herbs. The key, though, is the time markers on the side. It’s not as annoying as a water bottle that says, “you’ve got this!” but it still offers a gentle reminder that you’re probably not drinking as much as you should.\n\nHydracy Water Bottle with Time Marker\nAmazon\nSometimes it is just better to have a giant water bottle, and HydroJug’s 64-ounce offerings are my favorites for things like overnight camping trips and long car rides. I’ve used both their BPA-free plastic option and the double-walled stainless steel, and both have their benefits. I love how lightweight and easy to carry the plastic version is—plus, it comes in a bunch of colors—but it’s hard to beat the sleek matte finish of the stainless steel insulated water bottle. The only downside to these water bottles is that they won’t fit in a car cup holder.\n\nHydroJug Half Gallon Water Bottle\nAmazon\n\nStainless Steel Water Bottle by HydroJug\nAmazon\nIf you come across a list of the best reusable water bottles that doesn’t have Nalgene and Hydroflask options, don’t trust it. They may not be the most aesthetically pleasing, feature-laden, over designed water bottles on the market, but there’s a reason these brands have been around for so long. In general, Nalgene is better for people who prefer lightweight plastic water bottles, while Hydroflask is the go-to for anyone who prefers double-walled stainless steel. Both brands make water bottles in a wide variety of sizes, with every possible mouthpiece configuration from wide mouth to straw lids, chug caps, and beyond.\n\nNalgene Tritan Narrow Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle\nAmazon\n\nNalgene Sustain 32-Ounce Wide Mouth Water Bottle\nAmazon\n\nHydro Flask Standard Mouth Stainless Steel Bottle with Flex Cap\nAmazon\n\nHydro Flask 32-Ounce Wide Flex Straw Cap\nAmazon\nEvery outdoorsy person I know owns at least one Camelbak product, and most of them have a Camelbak Eddy water bottle. It’s lightweight, leakproof, and easy to use while you’re on the move since all you have to do is flip up the straw lid and bite down. Takeya also makes a great stainless steel water bottle with a spout lid and a carrying loop that you can easily clip to your daypack with a carabiner.\n\nCamelBak eddy+ Water Bottle with Tritan Renew\nAmazon\n\nTakeya Actives Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Spout Lid\nAmazon\nIf you want your water bottle to feel a little fancy, or if you don’t love stainless steel or plastic bottles, a glass bottle is your best bet. In my experience, a glass water bottle is a disaster waiting to happen unless it comes with a silicone sleeve, which both of these do. I’ve never met a W&P Porter product I didn’t love, and their glass water bottle is no exception. It comes in a few on-trend color options, but I’m partial to the Terazzo Blush. Purifyou also makes a great glass water bottle with volume markers on the sleeve and an O-ring carrying handle on the screw-top lid. Glass bottles are also dishwasher safe, which makes it easy to avoid the dreaded feeling that your water bottle isn’t as clean as you want it to be.\n\nW&P Porter Glass Water Bottle with Protective Silicone Sleeve\nAmazon\n\npurifyou Premium Glass Water Bottle\nAmazon\nSometimes it’s nice to have the option of a reusable water bottle without committing to carrying one around for the rest of eternity. A lot of collapsible cups and bottles lack the structure to be truly functional, but STOJO’s collapsible water bottle is the exception. It’s made from food-grade silicone, has a leak-proof lid, and can be tossed in the dishwasher for easy cleaning. This is my favorite water bottle for commuting, since I can empty and collapse it at the end of the day to lighten my load.\n\nStojo Collapsible Water Bottle\nAmazon\nIf you’re the kind of person who adds “water bottle” to your “phone, keys, wallet” checklist before leaving the house, Dagne Dover’s water bottle sling is going to change your life. This This neoprene and mesh bag can fit a 32-ounce bottle in the center pocket, and features four additional exterior pocket—including one that’s just the right size for your AirPods. There’s also a detachable, adjustable cross-body strap, and a key leash so you won’t have to go fishing when you get back home.\n\nSloan Water Bottle Sling\nDagne Dover\nMore from Bon Appétit\nContact\n© 2024 Condé Nast.

We've rounded up the best UK coffee roasteries and highlighted winning products from each.\nOn those early mornings, we could all use a good cup of coffee to kick-start the day. Whether you reach for an artisanal pour-over or a cafetière cup, no one wants to wake up to the terrifying realisation that they have no coffee. Thankfully, with the recent rise of outstanding roasteries in the UK, finding your perfect brew is easier than ever.\nPerhaps the only drawback to the recent growth in specialty coffee is that choosing the perfect morning cup has become a bit of a quandary. There are now many roasting companies out there, all raising the bar in exciting ways and offering a wide selection for a variety of tastes.\nHighlighted below is a selection of the best coffee beans to buy online. We've selected our top 15 following a blind taste test that impressed across four main flavour categories: sweetness, acidity, bitterness, and balance. Due to the nature of artisan bean production, some of these blends will only be in stock temporarily, but we've recommended the roasteries, too.\nWe used only whole-bean coffees for our taste test, as grinding right before brewing produces the best flavour results. Find more about our tasting criteria in our testing notes below, plus discover simple brewing tips to take the guesswork out of that perfect cup.\nFor more on coffee, we've reviewed the best bean-to-cup coffee machines, espresso machines, pod machines, filter coffee machines, iced coffee makers, cafetières, coffee grinders, milk frothers and reusable coffee cups. Plus, read our guide to picking the best coffee machine for your budget.\n\n\nBest for espresso coffee\nCoffee type: house blendSourcing details of coffee tested: Brazil, Nicaragua, El SalvadorFlavour notes: brown sugar, red apple, milk chocolateRecommended brew methods: pourover, aeropress, French press, hob, espresso\nGrind is a morning staple for many London commuters, with 10 locations in the city and more on the way.\nOpened in 2011, Grind has been quickly scaled to encompass a variety of spaces and purposes. What keeps it all together is a decidedly cosmopolitan and craft-centered ethos, with an upbeat atmosphere that never slows down.\nGrind’s house blend is as simple and classy as it gets, and comes in a reusable pale pink tin that can be refilled at any of their locations.\nThe coffee itself has an emphasis on big, sweet notes, with just enough acidity to keep things interesting. With a medium roast, this will satisfy a range of coffee drinkers, as it doesn't have the bitter or carbonic notes that we tasted in other house blends.\nWe found it to be a solid all-rounder, performing well across different brew types and looking great while doing it.\nAvailable from:Grind (from £9)\n\n\nBest for pourover coffee\nCoffee Type: single originSourcing details of coffee tested: San Antonio de Esquipulas, GuatemalaFlavour notes: caramel, red apple, floralRecommended brew methods: pourover, aeropress\nKiss the Hippo Coffee was launched in 2018, but assembling a team of professionals with impressive coffee credentials has already helped it rocket to the top of many coffee lovers’ lists.\nWhile its blends are a safe place to start, we love its single origin lineup, in particular the Guatemala from San Antonio de Esquipulas.\nGrown in the northern highlands that border Mexico, this coffee benefits from a combination of high altitude, rich volcanic soil and heirloom varietals, all of which help to produce a cup that is refined and delicious.\nAvailable from:Kiss the Hippo (from £10.50)Amazon (£12.50)\nBest for flexible subscription\nCoffee type: single originSourcing details of coffee tested: Sertão, Brazil.

It's achieved B Corp company status, currently conducting trials on recyclable coffee bags, and also offers coffee in recyclable aluminium pods designed to be compatible with coffee pod systems.\nThe ordering experience is user friendly, too – it's based on how much coffee you drink, so it’s simple to calibrate how often you want to receive coffee.\nWe enjoyed their Sertão coffee from Brazil, which tasted of roasted damsons and cherries, with a sharp richness. We also detected some acidity and subtle bitterness similar to orange zest, which was balanced by a golden caster sugar sweetness and hints of dark chocolate. This particular release from Pact worked especially well with brewing methods that require longer contact time (such as cafetiere/French press or moka pot), which intensified the flavour profile.\nAvailable from:Pact Coffee (from £9.99)\nBest all-rounder coffee beans\nCoffee type: blend coffeeSourcing details of coffee tested: The mount blend, El Salvador/Columbia/BrazilFlavour notes: Caramel, red grapes, milk chocolateRecommended brew method: aeropress, hob, French press, pourover\nBased in the suburbs of south London, Volcano Coffee was founded by Kurt Stewart in 2010. Bringing his experience of New Zealand coffee culture with him to the UK, the company is committed not only to coffee being not just good, but also sustainability and ethically traded. They’re working towards carbon neutral status and pay their suppliers more than the fair-trade rates for the coffee.\nVolcano’s website has a regularly updated blog which communicates general information about the company, seasonal gift guides and a selection of recipes using their coffee, which all feels easily accessible.\nIn the tasting we were impressed by The Mount Blend which is a mix of beans from El Salvador, Columbia and Brazil. As a blend it has a more consistent flavour profile than a specific crop or specific harvest.\nOn tasting we picked up smooth sweetness from milk chocolate, plus even a playful note of candy-floss with delicate acidity to keep everything in balance. Subtle sharpness came through as hints of lime zest and sherry vinegar, while a light bitterness reminded us of grape and plum skins.

Taking top awards in many of the UK's coffee competitions, the team at Origin is made up of some of the country's most well-respected baristas, roasters and wholesalers.\nBringing home a bag of Origin beans is a surefire way to make your own best cup, especially if you follow the brewing recommendations on the back.\nWe tasted an Origin coffee from San Fermin, Colombia. Colombian coffees have a huge range of possible flavour combinations thanks to the varied, naturally occurring microclimates in the country.\nThis region is known for producing tangy, fruity and creamy-bodied coffees, of which this offering is no exception. The medium-light roast allows the acidity of the coffee to shine, while still highlighting the dark caramel sweetness in the cup.\nWhile this coffee positively sings on a pourover, we also enjoyed it from a cafetière, which produced a slightly heavier but equally dynamic brew.\nAvailable from: Origin Coffee (from £8.50 for 250g)\nBest coffee beans for budding baristas\nCoffee type: African blendSourcing details of coffee tested: Two stories, Uganda - Mbata 50% and Ethiopia - Rocko MountainFlavour notes: pomegranate, orange zest, silkyRecommended brew method: filter, aero press\nNorth Yorkshire based Rounton are working through a “road map” to sustainability. So far their coffee bags are carbon neutral and fully recyclable and they are involved with long term projects designed to support the communities that grow their coffee in places such as Uganda. With a professional approach to coffee they run training courses and supply coffee kit for home and commercial premises. They also have a fun side – it’s worth seeking out their brewing method videos via their website which include brewing coffee on a train!\nWe rated their Two Stories blend which is 50% mbata beans from Uganda and 50% rocko mountain from Ethiopia. This worked best in aero-press and pourover brewing methods and gave complex fruity bitter-sweetness that reminded us of pomegranate molasses and marmalade. It was nicely balanced with subtle vanilla notes and a delicate and dry finish. \nAvailable from:Rounton Coffee Roasters (from £7.75)Amazon (from £29.50 for 1kg)\nBest for premium and rare coffee beans\nCoffee type: single originSourcing details of coffee tested: Puerto Arturo, El SalvadorFlavour notes: chocolate orange, redcurrant and velvetyRecommended brew method: French press, aero press, hob\nBrixton-based Assembly Roastery was founded in 2015 with a focus on quality, insights and innovation in the coffee industry. Passionate about premium coffee, you’ll find some very rare and exclusive coffee on their site. They go into great detail in the descriptions for each one, so if you feel about coffee the way a sommelier does about wine then this company will really appeal. As an example of their passion for premium coffee, their head roaster Claire Wallace won this year’s United Kingdom Barista Championship before heading to the World Barista Championships in Melbourne, where she came third in the final. The coffee that she used in this competition is still available on their website.\nFor tasting we enjoyed their Puerto Arturo coffee from El Salvador. This was a light and easy drinking coffee so benefitted from the longer contact or slower brewing methods. Once brewed it really was velvety smooth and gave us hints of creamy milk chocolate and rich hazelnut truffles.\nAvailable from:Assembly Coffee (from £10)\n\n\nBest for French press coffee\nCoffee type: special release single originSourcing details of coffee tested: Daterra Estate, BrazilFlavour notes: chewy caramel, tropical fruits, brown spiceRecommended brew method: pour-over, Aeropress, French press\nRoasted in the small town of Cirencester in Gloucestershire, the people behind Rave have started making coffee without much fuss.\nWith unpretentious packaging and an aim to make coffee both affordable and sustainable, the team has an open-door ethos that's supported by its ethical sourcing program. With a wide selection of beans as well as brewing guides and barista kits available online, Rave is like a neighbourhood roastery, but its products are delivered straight to your door.\nIn addition to its blends and single origins, Rave’s masterpiece collection features small and unusual lots of coffee – packaged in 80g gold tins – that allows the average drinker to sample coffees that might otherwise be too rare or pricey for everyday consumption.\nThe seasonal offer we sampled, a Brazilian coffee from the rare Acaua coffee tree, is made using a special fermentation process that increases the sweetness and acidity of the brew.\nThe result is a combination of the traditional Brazilian flavours of caramel and chocolate with more exotic notes of pineapple, mango, and cardamon. We loved this coffee from a cafetière, where its creamy texture combined with the lighter acidity to make a perfectly balanced cup.\nAvailable from:Rave (from £6.08 for whole beans)\nBest for coffee bean blends\nCoffee type: intense espresso roastSourcing details of coffee tested: House espresso, Brazil.Flavour notes: Dark chocolate and almondRecommended brew method: aero press, pourover, French press, espresso\nPresto have been established for around 3 years and are a B-Corp certified company. They are looking to reduce their carbon emissions and have 100% recyclable packaging across all of their products. On their website you’ll find a blog that covers brew methods, gift guides, sustainability updates and recipes.\nThey have a concise range of 5 blends going from intense espresso roast (made up of 100% arabica) to their crema espresso combining both arabica and robusta and then a ‘rocket roast’ which is 100% robusta. They also sell a decaf blend, plus coffee in instant or coffee bag form.\nDespite appearing like a very dark roast, the house intense espresso roast beans are classified as medium-dark and the resulting flavour is beautifully balanced. It made for a robust espresso with lots of dark chocolate, but without an excess of bitterness. It’s still well balanced when brewed in varying methods – for instance using an aero-press we picked up lots of marzipan sweetness.\nAvailable from:Presto Coffee, from £7.99Amazon (from £4.99)\nBest coffee beans for letterbox delivery\nCoffee type: single originSourcing details of coffee tested: Honduras single originFlavour notes: walnuts, milk chocolate, maltRecommended brew method: aero press, pourover,\nPerhaps best known for their compostable coffee pods, Halō also sell whole beans in their signature slim letterbox friendly boxes. Halō has a strong emphasis on sustainable packaging with a compostable bio-laminate sleeve covering the recyclable cardboard box container.\nWe tried the Honduras single origin coffee beans and found that these tasted best with shorter contact time brew methods such as aero press or pourover/filter. We enjoyed the easy drinking smoothness of the coffee which delivered rounded rich flavours, bringing forth notes of sweet and buttery hazelnut shortbread biscuits. Also detected a hint of maple syrup and squidgy dates which was balanced by a touch of balsamic vinegar as the subtle acidity. For the bitter notes we found a walnut skin character which was pleasant without being overbearing.\nAvailable from:HALŌ Coffee (from £8)\nBest coffee beans with a social mission\nCoffee type:Sourcing details of coffee tested: La conserva, GuatemalaFlavour notes: Peach, mango, vanillaRecommended brew method: aero press, pourover/filter\nRedemption Roasters was founded in 2016 by university friends Ted and Max, who had worked together and separately in coffee for a few years first. The company is founded on the principle of helping to reduce reoffending rates and preventing at-risk people from getting into trouble by giving them skills and experience in the coffee business both as roasters and baristas.\nThey sell coffee blends (such as The Wing, The Block and The Yard, reflecting their ethos) in orange packaging as well as seasonal single origin varietals in blue bags.\nIn addition to providing training and running a roastery from within a prison they have also partnered with Community Arts Projects, who exhibits art work of inmates from UK prisons. Some of this artwork is featured on the coffee description cards that accompanies their limited edition single origin coffees.\nWe tried the La Conserva coffee from Guatemala, which Redemption class as one of their filter coffees. On tasting we would agree, as it performed best in the pourover, aero press and French press serves. We picked up on some interesting acidity reminiscent of underripe nectarines and mangos. The bitterness was low but complex conjuring up toasted oats. This was an overall balanced coffee with a dry finish leaving a pleasant aftertaste of cobnuts and vanilla biscuits.\nAvailable from:Redemption Roasters (from £8.90)\nBest coffee beans for gifting\nCoffee type: espresso blendSourcing details of coffee tested: Level up espresso, Columbia/VietnamFlavour notes: red berries, caramel & pecanRecommended brew method: pourover, hob, French press aeropress, espresso\nBalance have 3 hero coffee products - their “stability”, “rotate” and “level up” blends. They are also moving into the world of mushroom coffee with a collaboration with Lions Mane.\nA relative newcomer to the world of coffee, Balance was founded in 2020 during lockdown. Their website is easy to navigate and it’s simple to order the coffee as whole bean, cafetière, filter or espresso ground.\nWe tried their “Level up” espresso blend and were pleasantly surprised at how successful it was in all methods of brewing. It delivered a lot of rich, mouth coating sweetness particularly in the pour over/filter method, giving off flavours of sticky toffee pudding and pecan pie. The acidity and bitterness came through as hints of grapefruit and we detected lots of high cocoa chocolate and pecan skins.\nAvailable from:Balance Coffee (from £9.49)\n\n\nBest for aeropress coffee\nCoffee type: single originSourcing details of coffee tested: Mutana 66, BurundiFlavour notes: yellow nectarine, floral, red berriesRecommended brew method: pourover, aeropress\nSourcing coffee can be a complicated process, with dozens of origins to choose from and a huge number of players between the farms and the final customer.\nTaking a risk on a lesser-known origin can be hard for roasters who may not know how to market or roast the coffee, but the team at Belfast-based White Star has both the expertise and vision to invest in up-and-coming origins.\nThis offering from the east African country of Burundi comes from the Long Miles Coffee Project, an initiative launched in 2013 that aims to connect smallholder farmers with buyers across the globe.\nCoffees from Burundi tend to be fruity and even floral at times, qualities that are best highlighted by a lighter roast style. In addition to these more delicate flavours, this coffee has a syrupy texture with lots of jammy sweetness. Its juicy acidity and complexity make it perfect for a pourover, where its nuances can really shine.\nAvailable from:White Star Coffee (from £12 for 250g)\n\n\nBest for reduced caffeine\nCoffee type: ground, low-caffeinatedFlavour notes: jasmine, bergamot, chocolate, blueberries and stone fruitsRecommended brew method: hob, pour-over/filter, aero-press\nDorset-based Nørlo coffee roasts its coffee 'Norwegian-style' – it's inspired by the light and bright taste of the coffee the owners experienced during a trip to Oslo. It sells caffeinated, decaffeinated and lightly caffeinated coffee in the form of beans, ground coffee or pods. Its beans are all ‘lightly roasted’, which it claims results in a smoother drink.\nWe feel that having a lightly caffeinated coffee is a wonderful idea, and found it to be a light, delicate coffee with a wonderful balance of flavours. In tasting, we picked up malty chocolate notes and a complex sharpness, which was slightly floral – reminiscent of unripe strawberries. This tempered the smooth sweet notes of vanilla custard and ripe apricots beautifully. A great coffee at the more delicate end of the scale, without compromising on complexity.\nAvailable from:Nørlo Coffee (from £15)\n\n\nSweetness: Coffee contains naturally occurring sugars that brought out by the roasting process. While some beans have higher concentrations than others, the roaster is typically responsible for the sweetness in a cup. We looked for coffees with plenty of sugary notes and coffees with more unusual types of sweetness, which scored higher than those with more common features.\nAcidity: Most of us underestimate the importance of acidity in coffee, but the level of acid signifies where a coffee is from, how it was processed and even at what altitude it was grown. Acidity, like sweetness, can range from simple to complex. We scored coffees with more complex or enjoyable forms of acidity higher in our blind taste test.\nBitterness: When coffee is roasted, some of its inherent bitterness is diminished, making it more palatable for human consumption. However, if roasted too dark, the roasting itself produces bitter flavours, most of which we perceive as unpleasant. We looked for coffees with a low-to-medium bitterness, and with no acrid or carbonic notes.\nBalance: Much of what defines our favorite coffee experiences depends on our personal preferences. However, balance is a way of determining objective overall flavour. In our blind taste test, we defined balance as harmony across the three flavour categories. Combined with a good roast profile, these flavours work together to create a balanced cup.\nBelow are basic quantities and timings for making coffee using popular methods.\nFrench press/cafetière:75g coarse ground coffee per litre of water (adjust as necessary)Filtered hot water, just boiled (poured to an inch from the top)Total brew time: 4 mins\nHob:15g fine ground coffee (slightly coarser than for espresso)About 250ml filtered water (poured to the level below the safety valve)Total brew time: 2 mins, or until the pot starts gurgling\nPourover: 25-27g medium-fine ground coffee415ml filtered hot water, just boiledTotal brew time: 3 mins\nAeropress:18-20g medium-fine ground coffeeAbout 250ml filtered hot water, just boiled (poured to the top)Total brew time: 2 mins\nBest coffee machinesBest bean to cup coffee machinesBest espresso machinesBest cafetièresBest iced coffee makers and accessoriesBest De'Longhi coffee machinesBest kettlesBest coffee grindersBest coffee gadgetsBest toastersBest bullet blendersBest bread makersBest food processorsVisit our reviews section\nCheck out expert barista Celeste Wong's recommendations for the best moka pots, gooseneck kettles, coffee grinders and decaf coffee to buy on our sister brand, olive magazine:\nHow to make cold brew coffeeHow to make iced coffeeCoffee types explained\nCan you recommend a brand of coffee beans?

Tried some local beans from Dumaguete and not really a fan as well. I am unaware of local coffee bean roasters/suppliers yet that I appreciate\n  \n\n    I'm unsure of what my opinion is on Honduras and Columbian Pink Bourbon not sure if its a roasting issue or what. Honduras felt overly acidic most of the time maybe best description for it is stale? Or maybe I just underextracted it not really sure. The columbian pink bourbon was kind of bland on most cups.\n  \n\n    Used to like dark roasts and rich bodied coffee like Blue Mountain (the one is far from roast date so not sure how good quality ones taste), UCC Sumiyaki and their other beans. But now I always feel like they seem to lack complexity which I think I get more from lighter roasts that are often bright/acidic/fruity. So maybe I wouldn't like a large number of Japanese coffee beans since they seem to lean toward dark roasts.\n  \n\n    I have bought coffee from Blue Wonders coffee in Estancia mall before such as their Yirgachefe and Sidamo but I really couldn't bring out the fruity out of the beans when I tried several times on few different roast batches. If I brewed it wrong I should've at least gotten it right when I tried different methods but most of the time it was flat.\n  \n\n    I bought most of my coffee from Sibs coffee since they are affordable single origin coffees. I did enjoy at least half of my purchases from them though since they did roast fresh beans. I just recalled several times before where the coffee would taste \""grassy\"" and it was an unpleasant taste. I initially thought it was under roasted or not roasted properly but maybe it was due to the beans being \""too fresh\"" since I would have the \""grassy\"" tasting coffee taste great after I leave it in the cupboard for several days to a few weeks. But I do recall very few just tasting \""grassy\"" all throughout if I remember correctly.\n  \n\n    Since I have only tried buying coffee beans mainly from Blue Wonders and Sibs I don't really know if there are really amazing coffee roasters/beans out there that I haven't tried that won't necessarily break the bank. I would say Php 400-Php600 per 250 grams is the price range I would drink day-to-day. So never really considered buying from Good Cup coffee since their price to gram ratio is very much higher than your average coffee bean prices. I will maybe consider buying them if they have exceptional quality beans that may be worth it from time to time but I will need feedback on this too. Other than that i'm open to suggestions on the origin and/or which roaster you can recommend!\n  \n\n    Also, I do want to ask a side and off topic recommendation on the brewing methods. I used to use syphon a lot back when I was drinking dark roasts but it feels the variation when using this method is large. The results seem to vary a lot based on heating element, initial temperature of water, amount of water, amount of coffee beans, time it takes for water to draw down, and etc. Even if you maintain a fixed water/coffee ratio. Anyway I stopped using this method since it was such a drag and was hard to control. I also avoid french press since there were often fine sediments no matter what and I just didn't like it but maybe there are very high quality ones out there but for now I'll avoid it. Now I only use a porcelain Melitta style drip with a single small hole that I bought from Muji but the drawdown time varies a lot on the technique. It gets the job done with the cheap stainless gooseneck kettle that I've purchased. The last thing is I'm using a Timemore hand grinder worth between Php 2,000 - Php 3,000 it did produce decent consistency but I really have no basis for comparison besides the cheap coffee grinders I used to sell in Shopee which were horrible. Not sure if there are other methods that will yield better and more consistent results.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten by Arne Preuss (Coffee Expert) & Edited by Nicholas Marshall (Chief Editor US)\n Updated on: 11 December 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe aim to provide you with the most relevant content!

Having spent years working as a barista I'm now on a mission to bring more good coffee to the people. To that end, my team and I provide you with a broad knowledge base on the subject of coffee.\nOur review process | Our team\n\nI'll admit to having been in two minds about writing a guide to the best coffee beans on Amazon. I mean, I'm always encouraging you guys to buy freshly roasted coffee beans from small, independent roasters.\nI’ll admit to having been in two minds about writing a guide to the best coffee beans on Amazon. I mean, I’m always encouraging you guys to buy freshly roasted coffee beans from small, independent roasters.\nHowever, I’m fully aware that lots of folks don’t have local access to high-quality coffee. Besides, there’s no escaping the fact that shopping for just about anything on Amazon is so darn easy and convenient.\nAs it turns out, there’s an abundance of high-quality coffee available on Amazon, ranging from exotic single origin beans to super-popular blends. So, I decided to order a bunch of different options to test out for you.\nOh, and just so you know, I tried to be as objective as possible. So, my list of the best coffee beans on Amazon includes best sellers that aren’t necessarily to my taste. That said, I made sure to include a few options I was already familiar with. I mean, I wanted to have fun!\nTable of Contents\nHere’s a quick look at the coffee beans I bought on Amazon to test out for you.\nChocolate & Hazelnut notes\nMedium roast\nEasy on the stomach\nCertified organic\nDirect trade\nCreamy and caramel notes\nThoughtfully curated\nSingle origins and blends\nIdeal gift\nMedium roast\nCertified organic\nNotes of toasted almond, vanilla and key lime\nDark roast blend\nCertified kosher and organic\nNotes of caramel and dark chocolate\nMedium roast\nSustainably sourced\nNotes of dark chocolate and stone fruit\nBlend of Arabica and Robusta\nCrafted for espresso\nNotes of brown sugar and hazelnut\nDark roast\nHigh caffeine content\nNotes of dark chocolate and black cherry\nCertified organic and kosher\nDark roast\nSweet and smoky flavor profile\nIn an ideal world, everyone would have easy access to freshly roasted, high-quality coffee beans. However, that’s just not the case. And let’s face it, supermarkets aren’t known for offering a wide range of sustainably sourced coffee beans.\nSo, if your local options include the supermarket or nothing, then ordering beans from Amazon might seem like a no-brainer.\nWith that said, ordering coffee from Amazon is far from ideal, even if you’ve found organic and fair trade beans. That’s because Amazon products sometimes sit in warehouses for weeks at a time. And as we know, coffee should really be consumed within a couple of weeks after it’s been roasted.\nAs an alternative to buying coffee beans on Amazon, consider buying direct from a small roaster. Pretty much all of them now ship nationwide, and you shouldn’t have to wait for more than a few days after the roast date to receive your package.\nAs we’ve established, there are plenty of benefits as well as quite a few drawbacks to buying coffee on Amazon. Still, seeing as there’s just so much coffee on Amazon, it’d probably be a good idea to narrow your search a little before hitting the “Buy Now” button.\nSure, you won’t be able to taste the coffee before buying. However, by taking a few things into consideration you’ll increase your chances of getting something you like.\nIn all likelihood you’ll know which roast profile you prefer, whether dark, medium or light. With that in mind, you should pay close attention to the roaster’s description on Amazon.\nCoffee beans with a light roast profile are usually brighter and fruitier, seeing as the roaster pulls the beans right after first crack. I like to think of light roast as being “transparent” in that it allows the coffee’s inherent qualities to shine through.\nIf you prefer something with chocolate and caramel notes, look for a medium roast. Coffee beans with this profile spend a little longer in the roaster, so their natural sugars are further caramelized. I find that medium roast coffee beans are ideal for use in a drip coffee maker or home espresso machine.\nFinally, dark roast coffee beans will be sweet, smokey and low in acidity. Some folks absolutely love dark roast coffee, while others find that it tastes burnt and bitter. What can I say? Vive la difference! \nChoosing between single origin beans and a coffee blend really comes down to the experience you want.\nFor example, if I’m preparing a pour-over I’ll always use whichever single origin coffee beans I happen to have on hand. I love being able to identify the unique flavors present in a coffee that’s been grown in one specific place.\nOn the other hand, I usually prefer making espresso with a complex blend that’s been crafted with espresso preparation in mind. That’s just me, though – there are plenty of folks who just love making single origin espresso.\nIn nutshell, single origin coffee beans are usually more “interesting,” while blends are more well-rounded and moderate. I say make sure to always have one of each!\nThis is a tricky one, and not as straightforward as it might seem. Sure, when you’re buying certified organic coffee beans you can be sure that no chemical fertilizers or pesticides were used during production. However, it’s important to know that coffee farmers have to jump through a ton of hoops to get the certification. And that requires a substantial financial investment.\nSo, as you might imagine, getting organic certification isn’t realistic for most small-scale coffee farmers.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that many non-certified producers aren’t growing coffee without chemicals and fertilizers. In fact, more and more specialty coffee farms are making huge efforts in terms of promoting biodiversity and best practices. It’s just that they can’t label their product as being certified organic.\nFortunately, many coffee roasters will include detailed descriptions of the producer, farm and how the coffee was grown. By taking the time to do your homework, you’ll likely get a clear picture of what you’re buying.\nLet me be clear: these days, there’s absolutely no excuse for buying pre-ground coffee.\nAs I’m sure you know, coffee starts losing its aroma immediately after being ground. So even if ground coffee comes in a fancy package it’s going to be halfway stale by the time you start brewing with it.\nListen, I get that not everyone can afford a decent burr coffee grinder. However, having recently updated my manual coffee grinder guide, I can tell you there are plenty of very affordable, portable and effective hand grinders out there.\nSo, always buy whole bean coffee. Oh, and do yourself a favor by getting hold of a coffee storage container. That way you’ll maximize the life of your beans, even if they’ve been sitting in an Amazon warehouse.\nWhile it’s not always the case that expensive coffee beans are going to be better, I’m always a little suspicious of coffee that seems overly cheap.\nSure, it might be the case that what you consider to be the best coffee beans on Amazon are priced very low. However, bear in mind that too many coffee farmers are paid a pittance for their product by big corporations.\nIn my experience, paying a little more will give you peace of mind, especially if the roaster can prove that it has paid a premium to the producers.\nAs far as how much coffee you should order, think about how quickly you’ll go through it. While it may be tempting to buy in bulk and save a few bucks, you could end up with a bunch of stale coffee beans if you only drink one or two cups a day.\nRoast Level: Medium\nOrigin: Mogiana region of Brazil\nTasting Notes: Chocolate, hazelnut\nAfter 10 years reviewing super automatics and espresso machines, and over 15 years reviewing coffee beans, we’re proud to offer our own Coffeeness Espresso Blend. \nComprising ethically farmed and sourced coffee beans, our Espresso Blend is expertly roasted in small batches to guarantee freshness.\nNotes of Chocolate & Hazelnut\nEasy on the stomach\nFreshly roasted right in Brooklyn\nMedium roast\nThis premium blend of direct trade Brazilian coffee beans produces rich, bold and complex espresso that’s ideal straight or paired with milk. Featuring notes of chocolate and hazelnut, our Espresso Blend is particularly low in acidity, making it easy on the stomach.\nRoast Level: Medium-light\nOrigin: Central and South America, East Africa\nTasting Notes: Citrus, caramel, hazelnut\nHeadquartered in Portland, Oregon, Stumptown Coffee Roasters has become one of the most popular and successful third wave roasters in the United States.\nAn early pioneer of direct trade coffee sourcing, Stumptown still prides itself on its ethical and uncompromising business practices. Even if a majority of the company is now owned by JAB Holding Company.\nOne of this roaster’s most popular offerings is its Holler Mountain Blend, a 12-ounce bag of which retails for $12.99 on Amazon.\nAside from being ethically sourced, the beans in Holler Mountain are 100% Arabica and certified organic. Plus, there’s a clearly labeled roast date on the bag, which is often missing from coffee beans on Amazon.\nThis versatile blend is suitable for just about any preparation method, although I found it worked best for pour-over and automatic drip. And while Holler Mountain is on the lighter side of medium roast, it has plenty of body and a pleasant, syrupy mouthfeel.\nI particularly enjoyed the distinctive caramel and hazelnut notes in this coffee, both of which were complimented by a long citrus zest finish. Overall, Holler Mountain is satisfyingly complex while being very approachable as a daily drinker.\nRoast Level: Light to dark\nOrigin: Various\nTasting Notes: Various\nIf you like the idea of rolling the dice and seeing what comes your way, the Bean Box Gourmet Coffee Sampler will be right up your alley. In fact, I’d say that this is the best way to buy small-lot single origin coffees on Amazon.\nThat said, the whole point is that you get what you’re given, namely four sample bags from four different roasters.\nFor example, I received a couple of medium roast single origins, each of which I’d buy again. However, I also got a couple of darker blends that weren’t really to my taste. Still, that’s part of the fun, right!\nCosting $28.99, the Bean Box Gourmet Coffee Sampler is good value, considering what you get. And while I’m not the biggest fan of coffee marketplaces, it’s not like you have to sign up. In fact, once you find a roaster you like, I’d recommend going through its website next time.\nEither way, this sampler might get you out of your comfort zone, which is usually a good thing. What’s more, it’d make a superb gift for the coffee lover in your life!\nRoast Level: Dark\nOrigin: Latin America, Central Africa\nTasting Notes: Toasted almond, vanilla, key lime\nOriginally hailing from Oakland, California, Blue Bottle Coffee was another of the third wave pioneers during the early 2000s. While Blue Bottle is now mostly owned by Nestlé, the company maintains eco-friendly and sustainable business practices.\nI felt like it would be a good idea to feature a decaf option on my list of the best coffee beans on Amazon, and quickly selected Blue Bottle Decaf.\nWhile I don’t drink decaf very often, I’d tried this coffee before and knew how good it was. Trust me, a 12-ounce (340-gram) bag of Blue Bottle Decaf is worth every penny of its $12.79 price tag.\nComprising a blend of certified organic coffee beans from Latin America and Africa, Blue Bottle Decaf displays minimal smokiness for such a dark roast.\nSurprisingly complex and full bodied, this decaf coffee makes pretty darn good espresso as well as drip and even cold brew.\nI detected notes of almond, chocolate and licorice when I made pour-over, and enjoyed a pleasant brightness on the back end. I’d say that those who love cream or non-dairy milk in their decaf coffee will be onto a winner here.\nRoast Level: Medium\nOrigin: South America, Oceania\nTasting Notes: Dark chocolate, caramel\nYou have to hand it to the founders of Counter Culture Coffee – these guys were promoting sustainability and producer relationships way before third wave coffee became a thing. What’s more, they’re still offering a wide range of equitable and transparently traded coffee beans.\nWhile you can buy a couple of the brand’s single origin offerings on Amazon, I decided to try out Big Trouble, which is a blend of coffees from South America and Papua New Guinea.\nCosting $16.49 for a 12-ounce (340-gram) bag, Big Trouble is Counter Culture’s most popular blend, and it’s easy to see why. Featuring a medium-dark roast profile, Big Trouble is a real easy-drinker that tastes great as drip, French press or espresso.\nDuring my testing, this coffee definitely delivered on its caramel and chocolate promise. I also enjoyed its hint of smokiness and full-bodied structure. Overall, Counter Culture Big Trouble is a crowd pleaser that everyone will love, whether they take cream and sugar or prefer a straight cup of joe.\nRoast Level: Medium\nOrigin: South and Central America\nTasting Notes: Dark chocolate, marshmallow, raw sugar\nLike Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Chicago-based Intelligentsia was an integral player in the third wave coffee revolution during the late 90s and early 2000s. And Intelligentsia is now majority-owned by the same corporate entity that owns Stumptown.\nFortunately, Intelligentsia is still an industry leader when it comes to maintaining long-lasting relationships with coffee producers and paying good money for what they grow. Plus, Intelligentsia sources some truly special coffees from around the world.\nI was excited to try Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso, which costs an incredibly reasonable $14.14 for a 12-ounce (340-gram) bag. So, I fired up the Breville Bambino Plus I’d recently been testing and got to work pulling some espresso shots.\nIt wasn’t long before I was getting great results with this medium roast blend. My shots had a lovely aromatic crema, and I picked up notes of dark chocolate, black cherry and molasses.\nWhile I found the espresso to be a little on the thin side, it’ll definitely appeal to those who appreciate that classic third wave espresso flavor profile. There’s a hint of sweetness to this coffee as well as a bright finish with just a smidge of smokiness.\nUltimately, Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso is a fantastic blend that won’t break the bank. Plus, you can feel good about buying this equitable coffee.\nRoast Level: Medium-dark\nOrigin: South and Central America, Indonesia\nTasting Notes: Hazelnut, brown sugar\nI’m fairly confident that all of you will be familiar with the Lavazza brand. After all, as one of the world’s biggest coffee companies the Italian powerhouse is always prominently displayed in supermarket coffee aisles.\nPersonally, I tend to avoid buying mass-market coffee beans. Still, I’m fully aware that Lavazza Super Crema is easily one of the most popular choices for coffee beans on Amazon.\nCosting $18.49 for a 2.2-pound (1-kilogram) bag, Lavazza Super Crema certainly represents good value. And as its name suggests, this medium roast blend of Arabica and Robusta beans has been crafted specifically for espresso.\nWith that in mind, I focused on espresso preparation during my testing. I have to say the results were very convincing – my shots were rich and full-bodied, with a hint of smoky sweetness. Plus, the Lavazza beans produced heaps of aromatic crema, thanks to the Robusta beans. Oh, and this coffee produces quite the kick, so don’t say you weren’t warned!\nUltimately, Lavazza Super Crema is ideal for those who prefer Italian-style espresso over trendy third wave coffee. I’d also recommend it for use in super automatic espresso machines, which will do a great job of highlighting its brown sugar and chocolate notes.\nRoast Level: Dark\nOrigin: South America, Africa, Indonesia\nTasting Notes: Dark chocolate, black cherry\nI’ll admit to having been a little afraid to try Death Wish Coffee Dark Roast. For starters, I’m not really a huge fan of super dark roast beans. Plus, any coffee that comes with a warning about it being the world’s strongest coffee gets my heart racing before I’ve even taken a sip.\nStill, I know that Death Wish Dark Roast is one of the best-selling coffees on Amazon, so I figured I’d take one for the Coffeeness team.\nI prepared this blend of Arabica and Robusta as a pour-over, but I can see it being a great option for automatic drip, French press or cold brew. As it happens, I was surprised at how smooth my cup of coffee was, although there was plenty of smokiness and some bittersweet notes. I particularly enjoyed the long finish, especially once I’d added a little cream.\nHowever, I can attest to the fact that this coffee is very strong indeed. Let’s just say you should sip Death Wish Dark Roast nice and slowly.\nI paid $16.48 on Amazon for a 1-pound (454-gram) bag, which isn’t too bad at all. Oh, and you should know that Death Wish Coffee is both Fair Trade Certified and certified USDA Organic, so you can feel good about buying its products.\nRoast Level: Dark\nOrigin: Indonesia, South America\nTasting Notes: Chocolate malt, molasses, licorice\nKicking Horse Coffee is another really popular brand with several medium and dark roast options. I decided to test out Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass, which is one of the company’s best-sellers.\nAnother dark roast coffee, Kick Ass costs $25.00 for a 2.2-pound (1-kilogram) bag. Fortunately, Kick Ass consists of 100% Arabica beans, sustainably sourced from farms in Indonesia and South America. And after having previously endured Death Wish Coffee’s “World’s Strongest Coffee,” I was glad to take a break from caffeine-rich Robusta.\nThat’s not to say I didn’t get a good buzz from Kicking Horse Kick Ass, it’s just that I didn’t feel like my head was going to explode! Besides, I actually enjoyed this coffee’s notes of cedar, cocoa liqueur and stone fruit. What’s more, by adding a little cream I managed to temper the coffee’s earthy bitterness.\nWith its deep complexity and long, satisfying finish, Kicking Horse Kick Ass will definitely appeal to fans of dark roast coffee. And although I’m more of a fan of light, fruity coffee beans, I could see myself enjoying this coffee on cold winter mornings.\nI’m actually glad that I decided to go ahead with this guide to the best coffee beans on Amazon. Caffeine jitters aside, I had a great time testing all the beans I found, and I was surprised by how many quality roasters are represented on the platform.\nSure, buying coffee on Amazon is far from ideal, not least because it won’t be as fresh as you might like. However, if you’re graduating from crappy supermarket pre-ground to quality whole bean coffee, any of the options on my list will represent a huge step up.\nWhat are the best coffee beans on Amazon in your opinion? Have I missed a roaster that shouldn’t be overlooked?

She has personally tested nearly 300 bags, jeans, bras, shoes, and more.\nOne of our picks, the Herschel Classic Backpack XL, received a slight model update in summer 2024; it is now a 0.5-inch larger all around, and its striped interior liner is no longer red and white.\nA great school backpack is a constant companion, carrying all of the essentials for a long day of classes, clubs, sports, internships, and more. But it’s not just for toting gear—a backpack is a wardrobe staple and an opportunity for students to express their personal style. So it’s important to find one that’s versatile, good-looking, comfy, and durable enough to stand up to plenty of wear.\n\nSince our first round of testing, in 2015, we’ve tried dozens of backpacks in a variety of styles. The five we recommend are the best we’ve found for high school and college students: an ergonomically pleasing pack, a nostalgic bag with timeless appeal, a versatile yet polished workhorse, a roomy and classic school backpack, and a well-organized pack with streetwear cred.\nAdvertisement\nWith its padded mesh straps and back panels, this sporty-looking pack makes carrying heavy loads lighter and comfier. It also has the easiest-to-use water-bottle pockets of any bag we’ve tested, as well as a removable laptop sleeve—but it could use more interior organization.\nIf you have lots of stuff to haul around—big textbooks, a large water bottle, or bulky gym gear—the Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L is a friend in need. The bag’s ergonomic and comfort features keep heavy loads feeling light. Plus, it has a sleek, sporty design and is available in lots of appealing colorways that feel at home on any college or high school campus.\nIt’s the comfiest, most ergonomic backpack we tested. Of all the bags we wore, the Refugio was the best at distributing weight. Its adjustable, contoured shoulder straps and generously padded back panels are composed of a breathable recycled polyester mesh, making even a fully loaded pack feel light and cool. And a removable sternum strap helps to stabilize the bag on your body, taking pressure off your spine.\nIt’s packed with thoughtful features. There’s a roomy pocket on the face of the pack that opens via a vertically oriented zipper, allowing easy top-to-bottom access to smaller items, while the large main compartment is ideal for bulkier stuff like clothing and shoes. A separate padded laptop compartment keeps your computer and textbooks contained snugly against your back; tucked inside, you’ll find a removable padded 15-inch laptop sleeve with a zippered mesh pocket for storing chargers and school supplies.\nWe especially love that the Refugio has two side water bottle pockets, which are constructed of a stretchy mesh material that makes it easy to slide large bottles in and out, even when you’re wearing the pack. Compression straps, located on the sides of the pack above the water bottle pockets, can be used to keep taller bottles extra secure. After a year of use, one Wirecutter staffer who has this pack confirms that the pockets have retained their shape and stretchiness.\nIt’s tough and water-repellant. The Refugio’s outer body, constructed from abrasion-resistant recycled polyester, repels water and keeps your gear dry thanks to a PFAS-free DWR (durable water repellent) finish. All of its components—from the buckles to the sliders to the zippers—are of high quality and function just as they should.\nDimensions: 19 by 12 by 6.5 inches\nWeight: 1.75 pounds\nWarranty: The Refugio is backed by what Patagonia calls its Ironclad Guarantee, which promises to repair, replace, or refund any item you’re not happy with, at any point. For normal wear and tear, the company will fix damage and charge you based on the extent of the repair.\nThis compact, durable backpack is big on nostalgia and aesthetic appeal. But while its straps are lightly padded—a significant upgrade from the original Kånken—it still isn’t ideal for carrying extra-heavy loads.\nThe Fjällräven Kånken Laptop is a vintage-influenced pack, beloved by many a hip kid. It’s the knapsack that you (or your parents!) might have carried in elementary school, only more sensible and grown-up with the welcome addition of lightly padded straps and a protective laptop compartment.\nIt has an iconic look, with clever updates. The original Kånken pack was designed for Swedish schoolchildren back in 1977 and continues to draw a devoted following among kids and adults alike. The updated Kånken Laptop retains the youthful, stylish charm of its predecessor—available in the familiar Fjällräven array of colors, from muted grays to splashier shades of orange, blue, and mustard—while adding useful features such as a padded laptop compartment and cushioning on the straps. (The first iteration has just plain webbing.)\nIt’s ideal for midsize loads. I carried the Kånken Laptop—loaded up with a laptop, a change of clothes, a toiletry bag, a notebook, a water bottle, chargers, and other odds and ends—for a full 12-hour day on my feet, and it was so comfortable that I nearly forgot I was wearing it. But the lightly padded straps aren’t meant for shouldering heavier gear (think multiple large textbooks).\nWith an 18-liter capacity, this is the smallest backpack we recommend. But thanks to its deep, boxy shape and clamshell opening, it somehow manages to feel bigger on the inside (could this be the Tardis of backpacks?).\nIt provides easy access to your essentials. The Kånken Laptop’s main compartment is roomy and deep, with one slip pocket for stowing a notebook or textbook. A zipper runs around three sides of the backpack, allowing the pack to open like a suitcase—a feature that one tester appreciated when using the Kånken Laptop as an overnight travel bag.\nThe laptop compartment fits computers up to 15 inches and has a separate zipper, so you don’t have to dig through the main compartment to grab your laptop. (The Kånken Laptop also comes in versions made for 13- and 17-inch laptops, so you can choose the size that best suits your needs.) A zippered pouch on the front is the perfect spot for smaller items you need to access quickly, such as a wallet, keys, or a phone charger.\nIts double top handles come in handy for carrying and hanging the pack. This is the only bag we tested with this extra-versatile feature. One Wirecutter staffer who owns the Kånken Laptop told us that being able to comfortably switch between wearing the bag on her back and carrying it by its top handles makes navigating buses and other crowded spaces much easier. Plus, the handles help the bag stay securely put on the hook of a bathroom stall.\nIts material is strong and water resistant and ages uniquely. The Kånken Laptop is constructed from Vinylon F, a durable synthetic fabric that’s water resistant without the use of any chemical coating. I was caught in a downpour with this backpack and am happy to report that its contents remained dry.\nOne long-term tester says that after five years of regular use, the Kånken Laptop is still sturdy, without any ripping at the seams. Although its material can feel a bit stiff straight out of the box, it softens up after a few months of wear and develops a unique weathered patina over time.\nDimensions: 15.7 by 11 by 6.3 inches\nWeight: 1 pound\nWarranty: The Kånken Laptop is covered by a limited lifetime warranty that offers repair or replacement for products purchased from authorized sellers. The warranty does not cover normal wear and tear.\nAdvertisement\nA sleek design and utilitarian features (such as a luggage pass-through and magnetic top closure) make this sophisticated bag feel pricier than it is. But unlike our other picks, it isn’t backed by a warranty.\nEverlane’s The ReNew Transit Backpack is a versatile, feature-packed bag that delivers on both form and function. It’s ideal if you’re looking for an understated pack that easily transitions from campus to the office to the airport and beyond. And its polished appearance belies its sub-$100 price.\nIt has a clean, wear-anywhere aesthetic. The Transit’s sleek, contemporary aesthetic makes it appropriate for nearly any setting; it functions just as seamlessly as a mature professional bag as a student backpack. The recycled-polyester exterior comes in a pleasing array of muted hues.\nIt’s light and adjustable. Featuring an ultra-lightweight build and padded, subtly contoured straps, this 27-liter pack was comfortable for carrying medium-size loads in our tests. We found it easy to adjust the straps to get the perfect fit.\nIt has smart internal organization and extra features that make life easier. A spacious front zip pocket affords quick access to on-the-go essentials, so you don’t need to take the bag off every time you flash your ID or swipe a transit card. The bag’s fold-over top has another roomy zip pocket, and is secured with a convenient magnetic closure—a favorite feature among all of our testers, and a plus if you have reduced manual dexterity.\nThe Transit’s main compartment has two slip pockets for notebooks or folders and an interior water-bottle pocket, while a second, exterior water-bottle pocket on the opposite side offers added versatility. A zipper along the side of the bag opens to a separate, lightly padded laptop pocket that can accommodate computers up to 15 inches.\nNotably, this is our only school backpack pick that’s equipped with a luggage pass-through strap, which allows you to attach the bag to the handle of a rolling suitcase when you’re on the go; it’s a handy feature.\nIt feels sturdy and well-made. Though its materials aren’t quite as hard-wearing as those of our picks from Patagonia and Fjällräven (and it’s not backed by a warranty), we still think the Transit will hold up nicely over time. The bag’s water-resistant exterior is made from a sturdy recycled polyester, and the all-metal hardware feels durable. One tester, who’s been using the Transit regularly for a year and counting, reports that her bag isn’t showing a single sign of wear.\nDimensions: 17.5 by 12 by 7.25 inches\nWeight: 1.42 pounds\nWarranty: none\nSimplicity is what makes this bag cool—and it comes in a plethora of colors and patterns, whether you’re looking to stand out or blend in. You won’t find any fancy laptop protection or organizational features inside this pack, though.\nNote: In summer 2024, Herschel issued a slightly updated model of the Classic Backpack XL. The redesigned version is about a 0.5-inch larger (across all dimensions) than our original pick, though the laptop sleeve, which can accommodate computers up to 16 inches, remains the same size. The bag’s interior liner—previously a red-and-white candy-stripe pattern—now comes in more-subtle tonal stripes that coordinate with the various exterior colors, giving the backpack a more grown-up (if less distinctive) look. We have not yet tested the new version. \nAn unfussy, functional bag with retro-inspired styling, the Herschel Classic Backpack XL has earned a dedicated fan base among cool kids of all ages. Plus, it’s spacious enough to take you all the way from a 7 a.m. sports practice to a midnight study session.\nIt has traditional school bag styling—in a good way. Charmingly simple? Yes. But the Herschel Classic has enough special signature details to keep it from being dull. The basic silhouette gets a dose of personality from its interior liner (in tonal stripes that coordinate with the color of the pack), corded zipper pulls, and instantly recognizable front pocket branding. It also comes in over a dozen colors and patterns, from basic blacks and grays to floral prints and leopard.\nIt’s extra-roomy. With a 30-liter capacity, this pack is the most spacious of any of our picks. Inside the large main compartment you’ll find an elasticized laptop sleeve that can accommodate computers up to 16 inches; you could also use it to store notebooks or a textbook. The Classic’s front zip pocket is ideal for carrying smaller items like earbuds, pens, and a wallet, and it includes a clip for securing your keys.\nUnlike smaller versions of the Herschel Classic, the XL size is equipped with two side water-bottle pockets that can each comfortably fit a 24-ounce Takeya water bottle.\nThe straps work well. The Classic’s straps are flexible, nicely padded, and easy to adjust. And one particularly thoughtful feature helps tame whatever webbing remains dangling after you’ve adjusted them: elastic loops for tucking in any excess.\nThe fabric is sturdy. The Classic’s durable body is made from recycled post-consumer water bottles. And though we wouldn’t want to get caught in torrential rain with our laptop inside, it’s inherently somewhat water resistant.\nFor $30 more, you can purchase the Classic Backpack XL in a weather-resistant fabric, but we didn’t test that version.\nDimensions: 18 by 13 by 7 inches\nWeight: 1.6 pounds\nWarranty: The bag is backed by Herschel’s limited lifetime warranty, which covers any bag purchased from an authorized retailer against material and manufacturing defects. It does not cover loss, damage, or general wear and tear.\nAdvertisement\nAs sensible as it is stylish, this durable polyester pack has plenty of cool storage options. But if you carry a big water bottle, this bag’s single, small-ish side pocket might not be practical.\nMay be out of stock\nIf you’re looking for a cool, casual backpack from a brand with recognizable street-style chops, the Eastpak Padded Double is the answer. It’s a more practical and functional—yet still fab—twist on the brand’s best-known backpack, the Padded Pak’r. The Padded Double retains the same general vibe and swagger as the original, except it has been elongated by about three inches, which confers some advantages: a pair of handy front pockets, a generous 28-liter capacity, and what we consider to be an even more attractive, well-proportioned silhouette.\nIt offers great organizational extras. The Padded Double has a large main compartment, with an elasticized slip pocket that fits most 13-inch laptops (it can also be used to keep a textbook or notebooks secured close to your back). Two large front zip pockets offer added versatility for wrangling smaller items that you need to access quickly.\nA discreet third pocket at the top of the bag unzips to reveal one of our favorite design elements, a phone (or sunglasses) pouch with a delightful, minky-soft lining. A hidden stash pocket on the back panel is great for securely storing important items such as passports and credit cards, especially if you plan to use the bag when traveling.\nThe bag has only one smallish water bottle pocket, on the left side—so it’s harder to balance out the pack’s weight on the right, and it’s not ideal if you carry a wide bottle.\nIts straps are a pleasure to wear. We were impressed with the Padded Double’s gently contoured, cushioned shoulder straps. Unlike the stiff, scratchy straps on other models we tested from Eastpak and JanSport, the Padded Double’s soft, subtly curved straps were well-constructed and comfy.\nIt feels substantial, but not overly stiff. The Padded Double’s polyester fabric is sturdier than the thin nylon exterior of Eastpak’s Padded Pak’r and Padded Zippl’r models, and less stiff than the material of our Herschel pick. Polyester is also inherently water resistant, offering some protection for your gear in inclement weather, even without a water-repellent surface coating.\nAll the details on this pack feel high quality. The zippers are outfitted with long pulls that make opening and closing the various pockets and compartments a breeze, and the bottom of the bag is padded and reinforced.\nDimensions: 18.5 by 11.2 by 8.3 inches\nWeight: 1.18 pounds\nWarranty: The Padded Double is backed by Eastpak’s 30-year warranty, which covers damage to zip pulls, sliders, seams, and some fabrics. Discoloration and damage to the buckles, zipper tape, and inside coatings are covered during the first two years of the warranty period. The warranty does not extend to holes, cuts, tears, or self-repairs.\nWe’ve been reviewing backpacks at Wirecutter since 2015, scrutinizing hundreds of them online and evaluating scores in person across a range of styles and situations. We also consulted with Sarah Lloyd, a physical therapist and director of clinical education at Spear Physical Therapy, for expert advice on how to choose a comfortable backpack and wear it ergonomically.\nAdvertisement\nTo choose the best backpacks for high school and college students, we focused on the following criteria:\nBags that measured up to our initial criteria underwent real-world testing. After loading them up with laptops, water bottles, running shoes, textbooks, groceries, gym clothes, and toiletries, we wore the backpacks in a Seussian variety of situations (on a train! on a bike! in the rain! on a hike!), assessing each model for its comfort and ease of use.\nWe also asked a panel of testers, representing a diverse range of heights and body sizes, to examine the finalists, and they looked more closely at each bag’s fit, style, and organizational features, as well as its materials and construction.\nIf you’d like a pack that fits all your gym gear: The San Francisco–based brand Aer makes excellent gym-ready backpacks that we recommend in our guide to laptop backpacks. We especially like the 19-liter Aer Fit Pack 3 and the 21-liter Aer Duffel Pack 3 for their combination of comfort, quality materials, and cool, vaguely futuristic design. At around $150 and $180, respectively, these Aer packs are more expensive than other bags we recommend for college and high school students, but if you can swing it, these backpacks are built to last and backed by Aer’s lifetime warranty. Both bags feature an ultra-durable Cordura ballistic-nylon exterior, YKK zippers, Duraflex plastic hardware, and an interior liner treated with an antimicrobial coating to ward off icky bacterial growth from sweaty gear. Other features include a ventilated shoe compartment, a luggage pass-through, padded mesh shoulder straps and a padded back panel, and a sternum strap.\nIf you want a chic, sporty backpack with a silky sheen: The Lululemon New Crew Backpack 22L Logo is a stylish backpack that looks pricey, but it currently retails for under $100. It’s made from a lustrous, water-repellent nylon fabric, and it comes in simple, monochromatic neutrals with matching zippers, straps, and branding. We used to recommend a similar backpack from Lululemon, the Everyday Backpack 2.0 (discontinued in January 2024), in this section. The New Crew has a similar aesthetic and a 22-liter capacity, with comparable lightly padded straps for toting light-to-medium loads. It has a dedicated laptop compartment that holds computers up to 15 inches, and the spacious main compartment offers plenty of room for bulkier items. On the outside, the pack has two water-bottle pockets and a front pocket with an attached carabiner. There are some things we don’t love about the New Crew: The three interior slip pockets feel flimsy, and the plastic carabiner on the front pocket can snap off if you pull too hard (if that happens, the zipper is hard to operate without it).\nIf you can spend a bit more on a backpack that’ll last long past school: The Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe is pricier than our other picks, at around $160—but it will last a long time, and it’s backed by Timbuk2’s lifetime warranty. The bag’s clean, utilitarian vibe can easily transition to life after college, its durable polyester exterior and waterproof reinforced bottom are extra tough, and its dedicated 17-inch laptop compartment is well-padded. It’s also seriously organized: Equipped with numerous pockets and a well-designed internal organizer, the Timbuk2 Authority Laptop is especially handy for wrangling supplies, cords, chargers, and other tech. It’s comfortable, too—like our Patagonia Refugio Daypack 26L pick, it has cool-wearing padded shoulder straps and back panels, as well as a removable sternum strap for added stability.\nAdvertisement\nThe bargain-priced Amazon Basics Laptop Backpack has good reviews, but we found it alarmingly ugly, and it was out of stock at the time of our testing.\nThe straps on the Eastpak Padded Zippl’r, JanSport Main Campus, and JanSport SuperBreak Plus were awkwardly stiff, and their material felt thin and scratchy in comparison with that of our picks.\nThe Hakuba from Lo & Sons is an extra large gym-ready bag, but it doesn’t have a padded mesh back panel, so it feels hot to wear. The 35-liter capacity also makes it easy to overload, and it doesn’t have a sternum strap. Plus, it’s much more expensive than our picks.\nThe small, stylish Rains Backpack Mini isn’t functional enough to recommend as a school bag—it’s better suited as a fashion backpack or purse alternative. The unpadded straps are difficult to adjust, and it doesn’t fit much or offer internal organization.\nThe Topo Rover Pack has a cute campground aesthetic, and it’s well-made and comfortable. But its tall and narrow shape restricts the amount of stuff you can pack, and we found the double-buckle closure annoying.\nThis article was edited by Ingela Ratledge Amundson and Jennifer Hunter.\nSarah Lloyd, PT, DPT, SCS, director of clinical education at Spear Physical Therapy, phone interview, July 14, 2022\nZoe Vanderweide\nZoe Vanderweide is a senior staff writer reporting on style and accessories at Wirecutter.

Here’s how it works.\n\nThe best vacuum cleaners don't just pick up dust, they save you time and effort, too. We've put a wide range of models through their paces to find which offer the best suction, the most convenient cleaning process, and the most useful tools. In short, the best vacuum cleaners to get your home dust-free effectively and efficiently. \nOur list includes cordless vacuums, upright models, cylinder vacuums and even a robot version, and we'll walk you through the pros and cons of each so you can pick the right one for you. When we test, we don't just look at suction power. We try out each vacuum on all kinds of messes, and we consider everything from how long their batteries last to whether they'll make your arms tired. And of course we take price and value for money into consideration too.\nIn our guide you'll find all the big brands and many lesser-known companies too, so you'll see great models from the likes of Dyson, Shark and Tineco, among many more: we're interested in finding the very best, not just the most popular.

It delivers excellent pickup on hard floors and the mini pet brush tool is outstanding.\nRead more below\n2-in-1\n\nBest vacuum and mop\nThis cordless option is able to vacuum and mop at the same time. And, it does a wonderful job at it. Plus, it can self-propel, so getting those floors clean is effortless.\nRead more below\n\nOur expert review:\nThe Shark Detect Pro Cordless is the best vacuum cleaner for most people, delivering cutting-edge tech and versatile cleaning. The specially designed floorhead is as effective on hard floors as it is carpet, and there are sensors that know everything from how dirty each patch of floor is to whether you're next to the edge of a room, and optimize suction accordingly for the most efficient clean. It sits right at the top of our best cordless vacuum guide. \nEven though there's only one extra tool included (a crevice tool), the Detect Pro can be used in a wide range of scenarios. The fact that the stick can be flexed so that the vacuum will lie essentially flat to the floor is useful for getting underneath furniture, and the LED headlights help you spot dust and debris in dingy areas. It's easy to transformed into a handheld cleaner, too, although a little heavy in hand in that mode. \nIn general, cordless vacuums have a little less power than corded models, and while that's true here, the suction is impressive for a cordless model and plenty strong enough for most people's needs. If you have mostly carpets, you might be better off with the Shark Stratos Cordless (#5), which has more outright power (but is a bit heavier) or for a truly deep clean, you can't beat a corded upright (#7).\nThe configuration we tested has a self-emptying base station with a huge dust bag, and anti-odor technology to keep things feeling fresh. We enjoyed how it minimized the hassle of cleaning, but if you're not so fussed about that, there's a version available without the self-empty feature. \nPrice-wise, at time of updating this model is discounted almost everywhere, bringing it down to the cusp between our budget and mid-range price brackets and offering incredible value for money (before buying, head to our Shark promo codes page to make sure you're not missing a discount). Overall, this is an excellent all-rounder that'll suit most people's needs, and the best Shark vacuum we've tested. \nRead more: Shark Detect Pro Cordless review\n\nOur expert review:\nThe Halo Capsule X is a slightly quirkily designed vacuum, but when it comes to suction it's seriously impressive. It aced all of our suction tests, and is our pick for the best vacuum for carpet, but it's equally impressive on hard floors. It looks a little weird, but it's comfortable to hold, feels light in the hand and is easy to maneuver too.\nUnusually in this list, the Capsule X is a bagged vacuum. That will be a negative for some, but it does have its benefits, including the ability to suck up fine particles like fireplace ash without ruining the motor. The bags are made from compostable cardboard and brown paper, to minimize environmental impact, but they do represent an ongoing cost.\nBattery life is decent, and the batteries are swappable, so you can have two charged and ready to go at any time. If you want smart features, look elsewhere in this list, but for pure suction power in a cordless form factor, the Halo Capsule X is an excellent choice. \nRead our full Halo Capsule X Pet Max review\n\nOur expert review:\nIf you're on a tight budget or are a student looking for something that will do the job without breaking the bank, we rate the Shark Stratos Corded Stick as the best cheap vacuum around. The main sacrifice you'll need to make for that low price is that it's corded. If you can deal with that, you're getting superb suction (corded models often beat cordless on this front), a lightweight and versatile design, effective anti hair-wrap floorheads and even the little bonus of an Odor-Neutralizing puck to keep everything smelling fresh. \nThere are two slightly different versions of this vacuum – the HZ3000UKT, which has a smaller dust cup (perhaps annoyingly small, if you have a large home) and a wand that can bend forwards to help you get under furniture, and the HZ3002, which has a larger dust cup and no flexible wand. Both are equally budget-friendly.\nFor UK shoppers looking to avoid being tethered to the wall, the Shark Anti Hair Wrap cordless vacuum IZ202UK is a similar price and also performed well in our tests. \nRead our full Shark Stratos Corded Stick vacuum review. \n\nOur expert review:\nThe V11 is our favorite Dyson vacuum, balancing that meticulous engineering and useful design flourishes with a not-too-painful price tag. The design places the cyclones, motor, dust bin and wand in a straight line to maximize suction efficiency, and it works extremely well in practice. This vacuum sailed through all our cleaning review tasks. The maximum runtime is generous at a full hour in the lowest-powered (but still very sucky) Eco mode, and in Auto mode it'll sense what kind of floor it's on and adjust power accordingly, for the most efficient clean. The V11 was the first Dyson to add an LCD screen, providing useful information like which power mode you're using and how much longer you have left on the battery, in the current mode.\nLike all the Dyson stick vacs, it converts into a handheld when you remove the wand. Which tools are included will vary by model and location, but all the ones we've tested have been well-designed and effective at tackling a range of different cleaning tasks. Our only complaint is that it can feel a little top-heavy, especially in handheld mode (this issue gets worse with later models – it's not too bad here). \nIt's not the best Dyson vacuum based on specs – that's the Gen5 at #9, which comes with some seriously clever features you won't find here.  However, that model is will be overkill. In terms of price to performance ratio, the V11 is our winner. And it's a worthwhile upgrade on the cheaper, older Dyson V8.\nRead our Dyson V11 review\n\nOur expert review:\nThe Shark Stratos Cordless is the best vacuum if need to tackle pet hair. It packs an impressive amount of power for a cordless model and boasts a few features that make it especially well suited to households with hairy pets (or indeed, hairy humans). The main floorhead – which is suitable for hard floors as well as carpet – is designed in such a way that it'll siphon hair off the brushroll as you clean, and direct it straight into the dust cup. This stops things getting clogged, while the built-in odor neutralizer keeps it all smelling fresh. \nThere's up to a full hour's cleaning on one charge, and a generously sized dust cup, which means you can clean for longer without having to empty it. A wand that can bend forwards to 90-degrees means getting right under furniture is a cinch, and on test we were also impressed with this vacuum’s ability to remove hair from furniture when used in handheld and Boost mode. All those factors mean it sits at the top of our best vacuum for pet hair guide. \nIf you don't have such demanding cleaning needs, you'd be better off with the Detect Pro (#1), which is lighter and more streamlined. On the flip side, if you need maximum power and are happy to sacrifice maneuverability to get it, you can beat a corded upright like #7. \nRead our full Shark Stratos Cordless with Clean Sense IQ IZ862H review\n^ Back to top\n\nOur expert review:\nIf you're after effort-free cleaning, you need a robovac, and our top pick in this area is the iRobot Roomba Combo J7 Plus. It's quite different from the other entries in this ranking, so if you know this is the type you want, head to our separate, dedicated guide to the best robot vacuums. \nThe iRobot Roomba Combo J7 Plus is designed to minimize the effort needed to get your floor sparkling. For starters, it mops as well as vacuums (like the Tineco option at #11), retracting its mopping pad when tackling carpeted areas so you don't end up with damp results. It comes with a self-emptying base station, which is especially useful given the smaller bin size, and you can instruct it using a voice assistant or through the app if you want to go totally hands-fee.\nLike most robot vacuums, suction can't match the most powerful regular models. These are designed to be used regularly, to maintain a constant low levels of dust, rather than for tough deep-cleans. The remote operation means most people will set it to run when they're out in the day, so they never really even have to see or hear it (we'd especially recommend this here because the self-empty option is noisy). \nOverall, we found this high-end model from iRobot does a great job cleaning. Its mapping is superb; it’s able to register large, split rooms and will continue learning even after the initial setup phase. Our only real complaint is that the side brush has a habit of flicking some debris across the floor, extending the cleaning time required.\nPet-owners will love the fact that it can pick up particles as small as 0.7 microns, so no dander or hair will escape its grasp (those with furry friends should also check out the iRobot Roomba i7 Plus, which is especially good with pet hair).\nRead our full iRobot Roomba Combo J7 Plus review \n^ Back to top\n\nOur expert review:\nIf you want outright power, a corded upright is typically the best option, and our top pick in this category is the Shark Stratos Upright. If you need something for deep cleans, it's an excellent choice, and on test we found it was great for tackling pet hair, too. The cord means there's no time limit on your cleaning session, and the large dust cup means you won't be traipsing back and forth from the trash can, either. Like many of Shark's newer vacuums, there's an anti-odor puck that keeps things smelling fresh. \nWhile it's clearly bulkier and heavier than the cordless vacuums in this list (including the stick option from the same range, at #5), it has been designed for maximum flexibility within that upright form factor. So the dust cup / motor part can be lifted off and held in your hand, and the cleaner head added to the end of a stretch hose – super useful for tackling things like stairs. If you're not sure it's right for you, our guide to the best upright vacuums has plenty of alternative options. \nRead our full Shark Stratos Upright Vacuum review\n^ Back to top\n\nOur expert review:\nIf you're looking for something lightweight that you can grab quickly to clean up the odd spillage straight away, the Shark Lightweight 2-in-1 from the WandVac range is the best vacuum for the job. This clever design can be used as a stick vacuum or in handheld mode, depending on where you need to clean. The suction is good for the size, although in our tests it performed better at sucking up fine dust, but required a few passes for chunkier debris. \nThis isn't going to work as a main home vacuum for most people, because the battery life is too short and the dust canister too small to make it suitable for large areas. However, for quick and easy cleaning, it's a great choice. It's simple but effective and extremely easy to empty, too.\nRead our full Shark WandVac review\n^ Back to top\n\nOur expert review:\nIf you want a seriously clever vacuum cleaner, check out the Dyson Gen5detect. Sensors enable it to assess the type of floor and amount of dirt, and adjust suction accordingly, for a battery-efficient but effective clean. It'll even tell you exactly what it's sucking up, via real-time reports on the LCD control screen; a feature that's interesting just from a data point of view, but can also tell you exactly when a patch of floor is clean and you can move on. A secondary fluffy floorhead has a laser that highlights hidden dirt on hard floors. A number of competitor vac brands include headlights on their machines now, but Dyson's laser is in a different league, offering effective illumination even in bright daylight. \nPerformance-wise the Gen5detect is outstanding, with an ultra-powerful yet relatively quiet motor, and effective hair-tackling design. (Although it's worth noting that for most people's cleaning needs, there are plenty of other, cheaper machines that will do a perfectly effective job.) Battery life is pretty much the best you'll find anywhere, maxing out at 70 minutes on one charge. It even lasted slightly longer than that in some of our tests. Our main complaint is that it feels noticeably heavy for a cordless vacuum, and uncomfortable to use in handheld mode. \nIts (very) premium price will also put it out of the reach of many, and Dyson promo codes are rare. However, if you want the smartest vacuum on the market, the Gen5detect is it. When making your purchasing decision it's worth also throwing this model's predecessor, the Dyson V16 Detect, into the mix. It has many of the same clever features and is cheaper, although the performance is better with the Gen5 (see exactly how the two compare in our Gen5detect vs Dyson V15 faceoff). \nRead our full Dyson Gen5detect review\n^ Back to top\n\nOur expert review:\nIf you're constantly vacuuming around after hairy pets, then the Samsung Jet 85 Pet could be your savior (provided you don't live in the US, where it's not currently available). This vacuum's mini motorized pet hair brush tool is the best our reviewer – a Labrador owner – had tested, making light work of dog hair on pet beds, car seats and more. \nThe main Jet 85 Pet vacuum cleaner head also delivers great suction on hard floors, and fine (although not amazing) dirt pickup on carpet. It'll deliver up to 44 minutes of vacuuming, depending which of the four power modes you use. (It's considerably less in the maximum 'Jet' mode, but this is so powerful you're unlikely to ever really need it.)\nElsewhere, this vacuum is ergonomic and comfortable to use, and overall a competent performer. For pet owners, and especially those with mostly hard floors in their home, it's as very strong recommendation.\nRead more: Samsung Jet 85 Pet vacuum cleaner review\n\nOur expert review:\nIf you want a more complete cleaning solution for hard floors, we rate the Tineco Floor One S7 Pro the best wet-dry vacuum on the market. This model offers top-notch vacuuming and mopping, and deodorizes and disinfects as it goes, leaving floors spotless. It's heavy at nearly 10kg, but its self-propelling capabilities make it super-easy to push about. \nAll that cleaning power takes a toll on the battery life, which is relatively short at 40 minutes on one charge. Our tester also found the water tank a little small, and the fact it needed to be emptied frequently a little annoying. And as you might expect, it's not for carpeted floors. \nThere are lots of useful features, including voice prompts and a bright LED display that lets you know what mode you’re using as well as water and battery levels. Being able to vacuum and mop in one go is in itself a revelation for how much time and effort it saves.\nIt's a bit of an investment, but we think the performance justifies the higher price. If you want something more affordable, the Roborock Dyad Pro is our favorite budget option. \nRead our full Tineco Floor One S7 Pro review \n^ Back to top\nAs we’ve mentioned already, knowing which type of vacuum to choose can end up leaving you confused. However, considering the type of property you have will help you decide. \nThese days, cordless vacuums are some of the most powerful vacuums when it comes to suction and they ensure you’re not restricted by the length of the wire. However they can also be some of the most expensive too. Check how long the battery will last between charges, and whether the battery is swappable, so you can simply replace it and carry on vacuuming, rather than the floor cleaner being out of action completely while it recharges.\nCorded vacuums are often more affordable than cordless models, and many have wider floor headers, which can ensure vacuuming is a much quicker task. Although if you have nooks and crannies the vacuum may not be able to reach them. For those with stairs, consider models with extra-long hoses so you can clean the stairs without moving the vacuum.\nRobot vacuums are good for regular cleans, however with suction that can’t match the best cordless vacuums they’re not suitable for a deep clean, and struggle to suck up dust embedded in carpets. \nHouseholds with pets will need a vacuum that can handle pet hair and if you want to use it to clean more than just floors, you’ll need one that converts to a handheld cleaner and comes with plenty of useful attachments.\nAnd if you have hard floors, look for a vacuum cleaner that comes with a dedicated cleaner head, which has a softer brush roll to ensure the flooring isn’t damaged when vacuuming. \nWhichever style you select, consider whether the dust canister is large enough to clean all of the floors in your home, without needing to stop and be emptied half way through. \n^ Back to top\n\nShark and Dyson are two of the biggest names dominating the floor care market right now, so if you’re considering kitting your home out with a powerful new vacuum, it makes sense to opt for one of these brands. But which is best? \nIn a nutshell, Dyson vacuums are more expensive but this ensures you get a vacuum cleaner that’s extremely powerful but still lightweight and easy to maneuver around your home. Dyson vacuums are stuffed with cutting edge technology too, from lasers that highlight hidden dust to innovative floor heads that can be moved in any direction. If you prefer a cordless model, they also come with long-lasting batteries too. \nShark’s vacuum cleaners are more affordable than Dyson’s offerings, but they can still match the stalwart when it comes to suction power. Shark models are not usually as sleek and stylish as Dyson’s, and they’re often heavier too, but they do come with useful technology such as the ability to stop hair getting tangled around the brush and flexible wands to ensure you can clean in hard to reach places. \nShark vacuums tend to have larger dust canisters than most of Dyson’s models, but the battery doesn’t last as long. So are they better? It very much depends on the layout of your home and your budget. Read our Shark vs Dyson article for a more in-depth look at the two floor-cleaning brands. \n“When the floor looks dirty” I hear you cry, but to keep your home allergen-free and your floors as clean as possible, you’ll need to vacuum more regularly than this. \nWe recommend vacuuming most floors once a week while increasing this to twice a week in high-traffic areas such as hallways and doorways. Especially, if you have carpet, as the longer dust is left, the more it becomes embedded in the fibres making it hard to thoroughly clean. \nWhile this may seem like a lot, vacuuming this regularly will ensure there is less dust to suck up each time, making cleaning your floors a quicker process.  \nFor more on this, head to our full feature on how often should you vacuum? \n^ Back to top\nTo find the best vacuum cleaner, we’ve assessed how well each model collects everything from fine dust and dirt to larger debris such as cookie crumbs and cereal. As well as evaluating how well floors are cleaned, we’ve also compared how easy the vacuum cleaners are to maneuver on carpet and hard floors, as well as whether dust pick up is evenly distributed across the cleaning head, or concentrated in one area.\nWe rated each design on how durable it is, as well as simplicity of emptying, how loud it is during use and how long the battery lasts - if it has one. For each model we wanted to know whether it was easy to convert into other modes; such as a handheld vac, the useful tools and accessories it came with to clean edges or remove pet hair, and that it didn’t require reading a thick instruction manual before use. \nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRuth is a TechRadar Homes Editor.

Learn about our methodology here, and find all our Best in Class guides here.\n          \nI’ve tested dozens of top-rated vacuum cleaners on multiple types of messes, including flour, sand, and cracker crumbs — plus scrambled-egg and applesauce spills for the wet/dry vacuums. (Fortunately, a trusty sidekick, my 1-year-old son, was able to aid in much of this mess-making.) In the process, I’ve considered if a model works better on one surface than another, or if it works equally well on hardwood floors and shaggy carpets, and how easy it is to maneuver.\nAdditionally, I reached out to an array of folks for whom a good vacuum can make all of the difference — including home organizers, chefs, cleaning specialists, nannies, and pet pros — to see what vacuum each recommends. These opinionated authorities have used their own vacuums to suck up everything from dust to dog hair to Play-Doh. There are many brands in this category, but the more dominant players are Dyson, Shark, and Bissell, and you’ll notice their models among our picks for the best vacuums, below. (If you’re looking for robot vacuums, you won’t find them here. But we do have a separate guide.)\nUpdate on July 16, 2024: Updated prices and checked stock on the occasion of Prime Day.\nOver time, bagless vacuums have overtaken bagged ones as the standard because they’re easy to empty and don’t require the additional purchase of extra vacuum bags. One advantage that bagged vacuums have, however, is that they keep the dust more contained when it comes time to empty them, though there are self-emptying models that can help with that. In addition to those considerations, there are three main options: upright, stick, and canister. Upright vacuums are the most traditional, with a handle on top, a swiveling brush head, and a corded power source. Stick vacuums have become more popular thanks to Dyson, and they’re often cordless (though you can find corded options). Canister vacuums, which are usually corded, are the most compact full-size option and come with a long hose that makes it easier to get into nooks and crannies.\nCorded vacuums are great if you’ve got a larger space and don’t want to worry about running out of battery halfway through your cleaning session. But of course, they’re limited to areas where you can find an outlet. That’s why we’ve listed the length of the cord, which ranges from 15 to 27 feet. For the cordless vacuums, we’ve listed the maximum run time, according to the manufacturer. (Of course, that run time is variable in real life, and it can change depending on whether the battery is fully charged and which power setting you’re running it on. But it will give you a good sense of whether the vacuum has enough battery life to clean your whole apartment or if it’s better for spot treatments.)\nIf the vacuum is too heavy to carry around, you probably won’t want to take it out often and clean. In general, stick vacuums are lighter than upright or corded ones.\nAdditional tools can turn a simple carpet cleaner into a multipurpose machine, tackling hardwood floors, upholstery, baseboards, countertops, stairs, and hard-to-reach corners. Some models can even be turned into a mop. Common attachments include an anti-tangle brush for pet hair, a crevice tool (an angled nozzle for narrow spaces), and a combination tool (two tools in one — usually a hard nozzle and brush for quick switches between surfaces and cleaning needs). We’ve listed the attachments included with each model. In some cases, additional attachments may be available for purchase.\nType: Cordless stick, bagless | Run time: 70 minutes | Weight: 7.72 lbs. | Attachments: Digital Motorbar cleaner head, Fluffy Optic cleaner head, combination tool, hair screw tool, built-in dusting and crevice tool\nDyson inspires remarkable loyalty among its customers, and it’s at least partly because of the effectiveness of its vacuums and the innovations they’ve brought to floor cleaning, particularly cordless sticks. The Gen5 is the top of the line and the most powerful of Dyson’s cordless stick vacuums.\nI tested the Gen5outsize, which has double the run time and a dustbin that’s over twice as large as the Gen5detect’s, but its top-heaviness and size make it a bit too unwieldy for many people. What blew me away was the vacuum’s built-in LCD screen that gives you a satisfyingly grotesque count of how many particles it nabs from your floors. One pass beneath my writing desk yielded 108 million microscopic crumbs — an impressive amount of WFH bagel bits. You can also find the screen on the Gen5detect, which is what I’d actually recommend to most people.\nEmily Ranager, director of business operations at Shelfie, an NYC-based organizing service, is “obsessed” with her Gen5detect and says it’s a favorite of many in her circle. In addition to its 70-minute run time, she’s a fan of the included Fluffy Optic head’s built-in light, which has twice the power of previous versions. “It illuminates invisible dust and hair on my floors, so I can be sure I’m sucking up as much filth as possible.” Ranager also raves about how it converts to a handheld vacuum, which is ideal for countertop spills. That’s likely why Toni Roberts, the executive pastry chef at the Ritz-Carlton, Chicago, loves using her Gen5detect in the kitchen. “It’s superlight and gets all kinds of dusty bits,” she says. “It also has multiple cleaning heads that can be swapped in, and the filter is washable, so there’s less waste.”\nIn addition to the cleaning heads and tools that come with the Gen5detect, you can also purchase additional specialized tools, such as adaptors for cleaning under low furniture or high-up places.\nType: Cordless stick, bagless | Run time: 60 minutes | Weight: 8.9 lbs.| Attachments: Duster crevice tool, anti-allergen brush\nFor the best overall vacuum, it was neck and neck (wand and wand?) between the Dyson Gen5detect and the Shark Stratos. Ultimately, the Dyson snagged the top spot for its run time, but the Shark has some major tricks up its cordless sleeve and is less than half the price. I was especially impressed by the Shark’s ability to bend at a right angle so you can slide the whole vacuum under tables, couches, and beds (you can purchase a low-reach adaptor for the Gen5detect, but it’s often out of stock). And like the Gen5detect, the Stratos automatically boosts its suction power when it comes across bigger messes. This feature, called Clean Sense IQ, visually shows you when debris is detected and when it’s clean. I tested the Stratos after hosting my three kid nephews for dinner, and we laughed about it working as a messy-eater detector when you run it under each dining chair.\nCeramicist Liz Burns is also a fan of the Stratos’s contortionist capabilities. She says, “It’s a dream to slide my Shark Stratos under my pottery wheel and beneath nearby shelves to pick up dust and debris with ease. Plus the whole thing folds in half for super-compact storage — it’s seriously amazing how small it becomes.”\nType: Canister, bagless | Cord length: 16 feet | Weight: 10.23 lbs.| Attachments: Multi-surface brush, crevice tool\nAdmittedly, I’ve never owned a canister vacuum for fear that the motor would be a pain to lug around. But in testing the Bissell Zing, I found it remarkably nimble on its wheels, following me around my tiled bathroom, over multiple mats and its own cord, with ease. Though I kept my hands free to move bathroom accessories, the canister’s handle and light weight make it ideal for carrying as well. With no maneuverability problems, I was free to enjoy the perk that canister fans rave about: pure suction power. I poked the wand into each bathroom nook and cranny, where the Zing sucked up every strand of hair in its path and even those off to its periphery. The machine’s retractable cord is the cherry on top.\nSarah McAllister, founder of the cleaning site Bleach, Pray, Love and creator of the Instagram account GoCleanCo, agrees that the Bissell Zing is great for hard floors and small areas. “It’s lightweight, so you can carry it around to get in tight or high-up spaces,” says McAllister. And the price doesn’t disappoint either. “If you’re looking for a vacuum that packs a punch and is under $100, this is a go-to. All of my staff carry them.”\nType: Upright, bagless | Cord length: 27 feet | Weight: 13.65 lbs. | Attachments: Pet TurboEraser tool, 2-in-1 dusting brush and crevice tool\nFor cleaning rugs or carpet, a specialized head with a brush roll works best for knocking dirt loose from the fibers. With its roller head covered in heavy-duty bristles, the CleanView loosens, lifts, and sucks up deeply embedded debris from carpets.\nWhile cleaning expert Sarah McAllister relies on the Bissell Zing for hard floors, she counts on the Bissell CleanView for carpets, noting once again that she prefers a corded option. “For carpets,” she says, “we like an upright vacuum with replaceable filters that you can clean easily,” which helps the filters last much longer — up to eight months. McAlister says that even after running other vacuums over carpeting first, the CleanView still manages to scrounge up a good amount of additional dirt, providing a truly thorough cleaning.\nType: Canister, bagged | Cord length: 18 feet | Weight: 13 lbs.| Attachments: Combination floorhead, dusting brush, crevice tool, upholstery tool\nMiele canister vacuums are widely considered ― by cleaning professionals, vacuum experts, and many vacuum owners ― to be the longest-lasting and best performing out there. Leah Guadagnoli, an artist and the founder of the monthly dinner party Fancy Feast Supper Club, which she often hosts in her upstate New York home, is a fan. “For deeper cleans, I’m in love with my Miele Classic C1 Pure Suction,” she says. “It works great for getting in between the crevices in my wood floor where flour and crumbs annoyingly always accumulate. This is for those nitty gritty corners of my kitchen and home.” It’s also the vacuum she uses to prepare for her mother coming over. “Mom’s coming to visit?” she says. “Better bust out the Miele!”\nShara Kay, a certified professional organizer and the founder of SK Organizing in Beverly Hills, agrees about the reliability of Miele canisters. She praises their high suction, efficient size, and retractable cord storage. “They’re expensive but last for decades,” she says.\nType: Cordless stick, bagless | Run time: 70 minutes | Weight: 7.72 lbs. | Attachments: Digital Motorbar cleaner head, Fluffy Optic cleaner head, combination tool, hair screw tool, built-in dusting and crevice tool\nIt’s unsurprising that the Gen5detect appears on this list twice. The qualities that make it our pick for best vacuum overall are what makes it a standout for cleaning up after pets as well. As I don’t have pets myself, I popped the Gen5detect in my trunk (an easy task with this powerful but lightweight machine) to head to my brother’s house and vacuum up after his cat, Piper. I beelined to her bed and watched the hair screw tool gobble up every last piece of fur without tangling. Next, I tackled the area around her litter box, swapping in the Fluffy Optic cleaner head, which illuminated my path with a precise blade of light so I could see each particle before the Dyson devoured it. While I couldn’t coax Piper into my car for further testing on the upholstery, I know that the Gen5detect would be equally effective for that task in handheld mode because of its extra-strong suction and effective attachments. Also highly appreciated: The vacuum’s HEPA filtration system that traps microscopic particles, including pet dander.\nType: Stick with cord, bagless | Cord length: 15 feet | Weight: 2.6 lbs. | Attachments: Crevice tool, floor nozzle\nThis amazingly affordable vacuum — it’s only a fraction of the price of the Dyson — is not just lightweight, it’s also extremely capable. I brought the Featherweight to my brother’s house for testing on his cat Piper’s preferred perch, a carpeted staircase. I watched the Featherweight slurp up all the fur on each step, noting how nice it is that the floor nozzle is the exact width of a standard step.\nTwila McGee, CEO and founder of pet-care company Nola’s Finest Pets, agrees that the Featherweight gets the job done for pet parents. “Even though it’s extremely light, this vacuum has a powerful suction that makes picking up pet hair on carpet, rugs, and hard floors a breeze,” she says. And if you think such a bargain price means the vacuum won’t last, McGee notes that she’s had hers for almost two years now and it still works like it did on the first day. Like the Dyson, it can be converted into a handheld.\nType: Cordless stick, bagless | Run time: 60 minutes | Weight: 8 lbs. | Attachments: Crevice nozzle, dusting brush, upholstery nozzle, multi-floor electric brush\nI’ve been mindful of not only being impressed by large debris pickup (“This thing just took down an entire ravioli!”), but also by machines that can handle microscopic messes. The Miele Triflex can do both, eradicating big crumbs as well as all traces of dust when I ran it beneath my couch. And because we can’t see every puny particle, the machine automatically detects floor type and changes its rolling speed and power, concentrating longer on carpet. This gives me peace of mind, as my sinuses are especially sensitive to dust.\nLongtime Shark fan and even longer-time allergy sufferer Naveen Singh became an instant Miele convert after testing the Triflex HX2. “I’ve always assumed Miele vacuums are all canister design, so it was cool to find out I could get the maneuverability of a cordless stick with the power of a Miele motor,” he says. Singh was impressed by the Triflex HX2’s ability to capture dust on both hardwood floors and rugs — something he doesn’t mess around with in order to keep sneezing and runny noses at bay. With its HEPA lifetime filter, this model claims 99.999 percent filtration, picking up dust, allergens, and viruses. “Plus it turns into a handheld, so I can use it in my car, too,” Singh says. “I’m the kind of guy who even keeps a mini trash can in my car, so this level of trustworthy cleanliness is major.”\nType: Cordless stick, bagless | Run time: 60 minutes | Weight: 6.8 lbs. | Attachments: Digital Motorbar cleaner head, Fluffy Optic cleaner head, crevice tool, hair screw (anti-tangle) tool, combination tool\nBefore the Gen5detect, there was the V15, which introduced laser illumination to the Dyson lineup and had some users happily comparing vacuuming to playing a video game. And while the Gen5 has a slightly more powerful motor (spinning at 135,000rpm compared to 125,000rpm) and a maximum run time that’s a touch longer (70 versus 60 minutes), the V15 is still a solid choice, especially for smaller homes where an hour’s worth of vacuuming is more than enough.\nAnd that’s not to say the V15 is a consolation prize. It’s still beloved among our experts, including Ryan Easter, who appreciates solid suction as the “chief cleanologist” at New Jersey–based Spark Car Wash. “I think the best vacuum is the Dyson V15,” he says, noting that the Dyson V11 ($480) is a great substitute if you have a lower budget. For his car, Easter only relies on the high-powered central vacuums at work, but at home, he’s all about Dyson’s versatile stick options because they’re “lightweight, cordless, modular, small, and still do a great job.”\nStrategist senior editor Winnie Yang also likes the V15 for its effective and efficient cleaning and compact design (and is a fan of Dyson stick vacs in general, having previously owned the V8 and V11). Dyson’s diminutive footprint in the home is also what appeals to Vivien Lee-Mayhue, a certified KonMari organizing consultant and the founder of Tidy Up Los Angeles. She owns the now-discontinued V6 and maintains that Dyson’s stick design is the best because the vacuum and its attachments can be easily stored in a wall docking station. “Vertical wall storage means not using precious floor space in a utility closet — a dream feature for professional organizers,” she says.\nIf you also need a mopping solution and can swing the additional cost, skip the Dyson V15 Detect and go for the Dyson V15s Detect Submarine instead. It’s basically the same thing, but with the addition of a wet roller attachment (Note: The wet roller isn’t compatible with other Dyson models). While the Submarine isn’t the most powerful wet/dry vacuum I tested, it can certainly handle daily messes, such as the spilled baby food and scrambled-egg bits I tested it on.\nType: Cordless stick, self-emptying, bagless body, bagged storage tower | Run time: 60 minutes | Weight: 5.95 lbs. | Attachments: Power Carpet/Universal nozzle, Power Mini nozzle, Power Mop nozzle (with two Power Mop microfiber pads), 2-in-1 combination tool, crevice tool\nAt first, the more than three-foot storage tower that’s included with the CordZero seems like overkill. Sure, other cordless sticks lean (and fall) awkwardly when not in use, but when mine arrived I wondered if it was really necessary to pair such an easy-breezy, lightweight machine with such a sizable station. However, once I vacuumed my entire apartment off one charge and docked this cordless stick, I realized the true beauty of the tower — once the CordZero returns to its stand, the dustbin empties automatically. Within the tower, the dust is funneled into a bag that you pop out and throw away when full (about once a month). No more hovering over a garbage can to dump dirt, only to accidentally spill dust back onto your clean floors. The CordZero’s hands-free auto-empty feature makes it especially great for allergy sufferers (no wonder it’s earned certification from the British Allergy Foundation). The tower also charges the vacuum and stores its attachments too.\nWhen Strategist senior writer Liza Corsillo tried another LG CordZero model (the A9 Kompressor Stick Vacuum with Power Mop) she was amazed by how much dust, dirt, and dog hair it picked up from her rug and how it outperformed her robo vac. “Please don’t judge me when I say this, but the dustbin on the LG filled up and needed to be emptied after just 20 minutes of vacuuming,” she says.\nType: Canister, bagged | Cord length: 18 feet | Weight: 14 lbs. | Attachments: Dusting brush, upholstery tool, crevice tool\nCompared to the Miele Classic, the Compact (as the name suggests) has a smaller canister, but still delivers the same suction power — 1200 watts. Note, however, that the Compact does weigh two pounds more. It’s a favorite of Chrissy Fichtl, founder of the Brooklyn-based candle and fragrance brand Apotheke. “It’s small and compact to store, but most of all, it’s easy to move around from one level of your house to the next,” she says.\nType: Cordless upright, bagless | Run time: 35 minutes | Weight: 11.2 lbs. | Attachments: None\nSo many vacuums claim to be multifunctional, but as with most all-in-one products, few really perform well at everything they claim to do. The Dreame H14 is one of the exceptions.\nI began testing this model with a layup for any wet/dry vac: a cereal spill with both solid pieces and milk. It was no problem for the Dreame H14, which not only sucks up such a mess easily but also filters solid waste from liquids in its used water tank. This makes disposal extra convenient because you can dump particles in the trash and liquids in the sink. Most other wet/dry vacuums leave you with a mixed bag of a mess that can risk clogging your sink or toilet. Then I moved on to tougher tests, including a week’s worth of dried coffee drops and stray beans on the floor below my coffee maker, as well as dried maple syrup. The Dreame H14 had no problem with either, though the syrup required a few passes. Compared to other wet/dry models I’ve tested, like the Tineco Floor ONE S5 and Ecowell Lulu Quick Clean P05, the Dreame H14 has superior suction. It’s also equipped with an intelligent sensor to automatically increase power for more serious stains, or gobble up light messes on lower suction for energy efficiency.\nAs anyone who has ever mopped knows, tackling your floors is only half the battle. You then have to clean your cleaning tools, a thankless task with grime-ridden mop heads and buckets. Here’s where the Dreame H14 really shines. Simply dock your machine and initiate self-cleaning mode, which blasts the rotating brush with hot water. Drying mode takes only five minutes, a major plus compared to competitors that whirl for a noisy 30 minutes — a nuisance if you store your vacuum within earshot like I do. Add to this the ability to lay flat to devour messes under chairs and couches, plus edge-to-edge cleaning to get flush with baseboards and cabinets, and the Dreame H14 is, well, a dream.\nType: Upright, bagless | Cord length: 25 feet | Weight: 12.5 lbs. | Attachments: None\nI wanted to try a more moderately priced wet/dry vacuum, and fortunately, the aftermath of a family barbecue presented the ideal testing opportunity. There was a minefield of mustard-strewn tile, crushed Cheetos on an area rug, and the remnants of a puke-y mess in the entryway from a friend’s daughter who went too hard on the bounce house.\nSetup is easy — the CrossWave HydroSteam comes with sterilizing formulas (for both hard floors and multi-surfaces), so you simply fill a tank with water and formula, then snap it into the back of the vacuum. You switch between modes (hard floor, steam wash, or area rug) on the handle, which sits at the end of a, dare I say, lovely copper stick. Within minutes, I tackled my multi-surface mess and was very happy with the ease of cleanup and end results.\nUnlike the Dreame H14, this wet/dry triples as a steamer, utilizing hot vapor to break down extra-sticky messes — a nice bonus. However, the CrossWave HydroSteam’s self-cleaning cycle flushes the machine’s interior but doesn’t cleanse the roller brush. That part has to be done by hand, and the brush has to sit out for at least 24 hours for drying in order to prevent bacteria growth and odor. This model is also corded, doesn’t lie flat, and has a smaller dirty water tank than the Dreame H14, which means more frequent dumping. However, the CrossWave HydroSteam is still a powerful machine at half the price.\nType: Cordless handheld, bagless | Run time: 25 minutes | Weight: 2.2 lbs. | Attachments: Hair screw (anti-tangle) tool, combination tool, worktop tool\nFor a dedicated handheld (rather than a full-size model that converts), I prefer the Dyson Humdinger, which nabbed top honors in our roundup of best handheld vacuums. Without sacrificing suction power, the Humdinger is basically a standard Dyson shrunk down, which made it even easier to maneuver over seats, the center console, and floor mats in my car. Plus, while most handhelds come with basic brush and crevice attachments, the Humdinger also provides a mini-motorized brush bar that I used on my toddler’s exceptionally filthy car seat. This attachment would also be ideal for anyone who regularly carts around pets, as it has an anti-tangle design that’s made for picking up hair. To top all this off, the Humdinger keeps on humming for up to 25 minutes — longer than any other handheld I tested, and twice as long as similar vacuums of the same light weight.\nInterior designer Kellie Sirna — founder of Studio 11 Design in Dallas — relies on her Dyson Humdinger to tackle messes in her projects, which include restaurants, hotels, spas, and even casinos. The feather-light machine comes with three attachments to make digging into console nooks and crannies, as well as cleaning car upholstery, a breeze. “It’s compact and easy to carry, making it perfect for keeping in my car … Plus, it’s relatively quiet, so I can use it at home or, if the need arises, on project sites without worrying about noise,” Sirna says. Even on days off, Sirna regularly reaches for her Humdinger. “As a mom of two, having a handheld vacuum is a necessity for quick cleanups,” she says.\nType: Handheld wet/dry, bag optional | Cord length: 15 feet | Weight: 9.8 lbs. | Attachments: Squeegee tool, crevice tool, carpet tool, extension wand\nThe Shark MessMaster is basically a scaled-down Shop-Vac for home use. I used it to tidy up around my toddler’s high chair after dinner, and was amazed to watch as whole raviolis, orange segments, and an entire dirty rag disappeared into the wet/dry wand within seconds. Realizing that I had basically brought a machete to trim a dandelion, I went in search of bigger messes. A repotting project gave me what I needed. The MessMaster went to work gobbling up large globs of dirt as well as excess sand and gravel. I then swapped in the squeegee attachment — conveniently stored on the machine itself — to scrape away any remaining residue.\nThe power of the MessMaster is unparalleled. Though I did find two minor downsides: The power cord doesn’t retract and you do have to carry the main unit (it doesn’t have wheels). But other advantages — like its built-in attachment storage and the fact that you can line the interior dust can with bags you already have at home — make this vacuum a solid tool for heavy-duty cleaning.\n• Andrea Arden, founder of Andrea Arden Dog Training• Liz Burns, ceramicist• Liza Corsillo, Strategist senior writer• Ryan Easter, chief cleanologist at Spark Car Wash• Chrissy Fichtl, founder of Apotheke• Leah Guadagnoli, an artist and founder of Fancy Feast Supper Club• Shara Kay, certified professional organizer and founder of SK Organizing• Vivien Lee-Mayhue, professional organizer and founder of Tidy Up Los Angeles• Sarah McAllister, founder of Bleach, Pray, Love and creator of GoCleanCo• Twila McGee, CEO and founder Nola’s Finest Pets• Patrice Novkov, founder of Mulberry Nanny Agency• Emily Ranager, director of business operations at Shelfie• Toni Roberts, executive pastry chef at The Ritz-Carlton, Chicago• Kellie Sirna, founder and principal of Studio 11 Design• Winnie Yang, Strategist senior editor\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

And while yogurt has a reputation as a high-protein food, not all yogurts are created equal when it comes to this macronutrient. \n\n Aside from being delicious in a creamy-tangy sense, yogurt has a lot of things going for it in terms of health benefits, including digestive and cardiovascular perks. And its protein content can help you maintain muscle mass, support a strong immune system and increase satiety after eating.,,\n\n We spoke with registered dietitians to get the six best high-protein yogurts and, to make things easy, we ranked them by protein content. Our experts also share tips for choosing protein-rich yogurts at the grocery store. Read on to learn how to get the most out of your yogurt with every spoonful.\n\n Protein: 25 grams per 5.3-ounce container (150 g)\n\n This protein-packed yogurt is nutrient-dense and low in carbs. “For those seeking a lower-carb alternative, Ratio’s Yogurt Protein Cultured Dairy Snack is an excellent choice with its impressive 25 grams of protein per serving,” says Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, a certified diabetes care and education specialist and author of the 2-Day Diabetes Diet. “With only 8 grams of carbohydrates per serving, this yogurt fits seamlessly into diabetes meal plans and low-carb lifestyles, providing a creamy option without added sugars,” she explains.\n\n Protein: 20 g per 5.3-ounce container (150 g)\n\n One container of this yogurt is also impressive when it comes to protein. “Oikos Pro delivers a healthy 20 grams of protein per serving,” notes Palinski-Wade. “With no added sugars and just 140 calories, it’s ideal for those managing their carbohydrate intake or watching their calorie consumption,” she says. If you’re on a weight loss plan, this yogurt is a high-protein, low-sugar option to help you reach your goals.\n\n Protein: 16 g per 5.3-ounce container (150 g)\n\n This unsweetened plain yogurt packs a protein punch. Add it to smoothies or homemade sauces for a creamier texture and extra protein. “Fage Total 0% offers a creamy, thick texture with 16 grams of protein per serving,” explains Kelsey Kunik, RDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Graciously Nourished. “It’s excellent for cooking, baking or mixing into overnight oats for added protein and a boost of creaminess,” she recommends. \n\n Protein: 15 g per 5.3-ounce container (150 g)\n\n Oikos hits the list again, this time with its lower-calorie yogurt. “With 15 grams of protein and only 90 calories per serving, Oikos Triple Zero is a top choice for those looking to lower their calorie intake,” Palinski-Wade says. “This yogurt contains no added sugars or fats and comes in various flavors, ensuring there’s an option to suit every palate.”\n\n Protein: 14 g per 5.3-ounce container (150 g)\n\n Skyr is another type of strained yogurt that has a thick, creamy texture similar to Greek yogurt. If you prefer a pre-flavored yogurt, this is a good option because each container contains just 2 grams of sugar, making it tangy but slightly sweet. “Siggi's Lower-Sugar Skyr delivers 14 grams of protein per serving,” says Kunik. “Its lower sugar content makes it a healthier choice while still delivering a satisfying protein boost,” she says.\n\n Protein: 12 g per 5.3-ounce container (150 g)\n\n One of the lowest-calorie yogurts of the bunch, “Chobani Zero Sugar yogurt is a great option with live active cultures, no added sugar and only 60 to 70 calories per serving,” Palinski-Wade says. Available in a variety of flavors, like blueberry, peach and vanilla, this yogurt uses allulose, stevia leaf extract and monk fruit extract to naturally sweeten without adding sugar. Research suggests that allulose, in particular, has minimal effects on blood sugar levels.\n\n To help you choose the best protein-rich yogurt for your needs, consider these tips:\n\n Adding healthy, high-protein yogurts to your diet can boost your protein intake and overall health, since protein helps support muscle mass, strengthen the immune system and keep you full longer. Choose protein-rich yogurts with minimal ingredients and added sugars.\n\nGreek yogurt typically contains the most protein, with some brands offering up to 25 grams of protein per serving. This type of yogurt is strained to remove excess whey, resulting in a denser and richer yogurt with more protein.\nDietitians often recommend plain, low-fat Greek yogurt due to its high protein content and lower sugar levels. With zero added sugars, you can add fresh fruit as a natural sweetener.\nThe healthiest yogurt is plain, nonfat or low-fat strained (Greek-style or skyr) yogurt. These yogurts provide a high amount of protein, minimal added sugars and probiotics for improved gut health.\nCarbone JW, Pasiakos SM.

Beneficial Effects of Yoghurts and Probiotic Fermented Milks and Their Functional Food Potential. Foods. 2022;11(17):2691. doi:10.3390/foods11172691\nOne of my favorite grocery store grabs is an individual yogurt cup. I grab three every week, so there’s a challenge: How weird can I get with the flavors? Will I opt for a tried-and-true strawberry banana? Key lime pie? An almond coconut? And what’s that – s’mores yogurt?\nBut beyond flavor, there’s something out there for everyone. There’s Greek or Icelandic yogurt; you could switch it up with a goat’s or sheep’s milk yogurt. Even non-dairy manufacturers are well into the yogurt world with coconut milk and almond milk options. \nSo how do they all measure up when it comes to your health?\nWhile any type of yogurt can fit in a healthy diet, Greek yogurt and skyr (Icelandic yogurt) are the healthiest choices because they tend to be lower in sugar and higher in protein, says registered dietitian Jamie Nadeau. \nThese two options will always be higher in protein because of the way they're made, however exact amounts depend on the brand.\nGreek yogurt is just regular yogurt that’s been strained to remove the whey or liquid. The result is a thicker yogurt with a more concentrated, tangy flavor. Because Greek yogurt is more dense, it has more protein than regular, unstrained yogurt.\nSkyr is also strained and requires much more milk to make than regular yogurt, which makes this thick yogurt a high-protein choice.\nFor example, 100 grams of plain yogurt contains about 3.5 grams of protein. The same serving of Greek yogurt has 9 grams of protein and skyr has 10 grams.\nBut if you’re not into the thick, tangy taste of Greek and Icelandic yogurt – don’t stress. Because all yogurt is healthy, you should choose a type that tastes good and makes you want to keep eating it. \n“It’s kind of an experimenting game,” Nadeau says. “You might choose a lower-sugar yogurt and absolutely hate it but you might like one that has just a little bit of added sugar.”\nWhichever type you choose, make sure to add some fat and fiber on the side to make it a balanced meal, Nadeau says. She suggests fruit (even frozen), cereal, granola, peanut butter or almond butter.\nYes – yogurt makes a healthy snack or addition to any meal. It contains calcium, phosphorus, zinc, selenium, iodine, riboflavin and vitamins B5 and B12, experts previously told USA TODAY. A 2020 study also found regular yogurt consumers had a higher quality diet, a lower risk of obesity and higher intakes of fiber, calcium, magnesium, potassium and vitamin D. \nYogurt also contains probiotics, which support gut health. Probiotics are living microorganisms that exist both naturally in the gut and are found in food products, dietary supplements and beauty products. They work against bad bacteria and maintain the amount of good bacteria in the gut, experts previously told USA TODAY. \nYogurt is also versatile – the health benefits don’t have to be limited to breakfast time. \n“You can use it for savory dishes, you can use it for sweet dishes and dessert-type dishes, you can cook with it,” Nadeau says. \nTwo of her favorite ways to use yogurt are as salad dressings and dips. You can make your own savory seasoning blend or try out a pre-packaged type, like ranch or Italian seasoning. Add seasoning to your yogurt and stir it up to make a dip. Whisk in a little milk to thin it out into a salad dressing.\nThe only drawback with yogurt is the potential sugar content. It’s about as easy to find a candy-flavored yogurt option as it is a plain one. \n“I always look at the label to check for added sugar content because it can definitely get pretty high,” Nadeau says. “Some of the Greek yogurts even have upwards of 18 grams of added sugar.”\nYou may be better off adding your choice of flavor to plain yogurt or choosing one that contains real fruit.\nMost yogurt on the grocery shelves contains probiotics, but not all do.\nYogurt is made by combining heated milk and bacteria, which begins the fermentation process and converts the sugar in milk to lactic acid and allows the milk to thicken and become tart. \nProbiotics are specific strains of this bacteria. Some yogurts are heat-treated, which kills the cultures. Others have live active cultures stirred directly in, rather than fermenting. The International Dairy Foods Association offers a “Live & Active Cultures” label to yogurts that contain “significant amounts of live and active cultures.”\nWhile some yogurts boost extra added probiotics, Nadeau says it’s more important to eat the kind of yogurt you like rather than stress over the kind containing the highest amount.\n“I don’t think it’s worth micromanaging,” Nadeau says. “But most yogurts do list the probiotics in the ingredients on the back, so if we look at the ingredients list you can see ‘this one has one type of bacteria and this one has five types of bacteria’ so maybe I’ll choose this one because I have a more diverse list.”\nUSA TODAY is exploring the questions you and others ask every day. From \""Can dogs eat bananas?\"" to \""How do I make coffee without a coffeemaker?\"" to \""Is Chipotle healthy?\"" – we're striving to find answers to the most common questions you ask every day. Head to our Just Curious section to see what else we can answer for you. \n\n\nBack in the day, if you were buying yogurt at the grocery store, it was all pretty much the same American-style, low in protein, high in sugar products. They tasted delicious, make no mistake about it, and we still get nostalgic for a good cup of creamy Dannon alongside a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. But now we know the amazing nutritional benefits of all those other kinds of yogurts that have steadily taken over the shelves — benefits like a surprisingly high percentage of your recommended daily value of protein in one modest serving.\nSo now that we happily turn to yogurt for help strengthening our hardworking muscles and bones, we may, regretfully, view it as a less than delicious undertaking. How sad is that? Well, there shall be no bland, chalky, or \""just eat it because it's good for you\"" yogurts over here. Instead, we went out and collected some of the most protein-rich options and tasted them all, ranking them from best to worst, so you get the best of both worlds!\n\n\nWe were highly intrigued by this more obscure product with a wallop of a label. Would it be as delicious as it is nutritious? Upon ripping open the lid, we found our answer. Super thick, almost pasty, and not very sweet at all, :ratio PROTEIN packs a 25-gram punch of the good stuff, one of the most on this list. When you lift your spoon out of the yogurt cup, it leaves stiff and distinct peaks that don't fall back into the yogurt. \nIt's an extremely substantial product and does have an odd, somewhat medicinal, and inexplicable aftertaste. But when it contains 50% of your recommended daily value of protein, well, some things can be overlooked. Gym rats will be singing Hallelujah and going and doing a lot of pushups, but for the rest of us, more isn't always more, especially when the flavor is funky in a bad way.\n\n\nIf you want all the creamy, tangy, one-of-a-kind taste of thick Greek yogurt, but can't have the dairy, it can be tough going. Most of the non-dairy yogurt alternatives on the market leave a lot to be desired. They can have a distracting watery texture that's the opposite of satisfying, and a funky taste like something's gone a little bit bad. And protein? Forget about it. Most of the time, there's barely any to be found. \nTake, for example, Silk's vanilla almond dairy-free yogurt, a nice try with its mere 5 grams of protein. Or So Delicious's somewhat tolerable offering with less than even one measly gram. So would Kitehill Greek-Style Plant-Based Yogurt do better? Though our expectations were low, the reward was high! For you lactose-intolerant individuals, make this one and its 15 grams of protein the first alternative Greek yogurt you try. It's pretty darn close to the real deal!\n\n\nFun fact: It takes a painstaking five days to make a batch of Ellenos yogurt. As the story goes, a father and son duo were making their handcrafted, family-recipe Greek yogurt in Australia, and an American flight attendant got hooked on just a taste. Eventually, these budding yogurt gurus moved to Seattle, and Ellenos has now moved to grocery stores across the United States. We had never tried Ellenos before this, so we were truly excited, especially after we learned about the backstory! Once we did, it was easily one of the best-tasting yogurts of all. \nWe could only locate the delightful marionberry flavor, but if the attention to detail holds across the board, undoubtedly the Vanilla Bean is equally charming. There are some issues, though, keeping it from ranking higher. It's wildly expensive, $2.99 (depending on your location; price correct at time of publication) for a mere 5.3 ounces. Another thing to note is it has 20 grams of sugar, so if you're looking for higher sugar snacks (or don't mind it) this one is for you. But if you're watching your sugar, another high-protein yogurt on this list might be more up your alley.\n\n\nHigh in protein and low in cost, Target's Good & Gather Blended Greek Nonfat yogurt is a cost-efficient staple. Picking up a big tub of this stuff is a wise move the next time you go on a grocery run that requires everything under the sun (because what can't you find at Target?). But the Greek yogurt aficionados in our tasting crew couldn't exactly become Target apologists this time. \nWe sadly agreed that it was a little thinner and less flavorful than others on this list, which is to be expected given the low price tag and big-box name. We liked it for its 15 grams of protein but didn't love it overall, which is okay because it's perfect for the yogurt layperson. Smoothies and baked goods would benefit from the Good & Gather yogurt addition, and it's an acceptable vehicle for sporting your new favorite granola.\n\n\nWhat even is Noosa, and what makes it \""finest yoghurt\""? Is it Greek yogurt? Icelandic-style skyr? Or maybe it's made in the French style, like the yummy Oui? By the way, Oui didn't make the list due to its low protein count. We were bemused, confused, and curious to try. As it turns out, Noosa is none of the above: It defies geographical genres by being simply a recipe developed for great taste. Noosa uses farm-fresh whole milk. Then, it adds three live and active cultures and sweetens it up with pure wildflower honey. \nSo much is appealing about Noosa, all the way down to the larger amount in each single-serving cup (8 ounces as opposed to the typical 5.3 ounces) and wide circumference perfect for topping with fresh fruit and crumbly granola. We really could taste the difference, too! That tasty honey means, though, that there's a ton of sugar (18 added grams for a total of 32 grams) relative to other yogurts on this list, so that's something to keep in mind if you're monitoring your sugar intake.\n\n\nIt's a classic! You'll likely spot this cool and composed yogurt cup sitting in airport markets or hotel continental breakfast buffets. It helps that it comes in lots of fun flavors you can try on your next grocery store run. Chobani's Vanilla Blended Nonfat yogurt has 12 grams of protein, no artificial flavors or preservatives, a touch of calcium to brighten your day, and 9 grams of added sugars. \nWe all knew what this would taste like before we even put a spoon in our mouths: creamy, mild, sweet, and, honestly, pretty vanilla. This one isn't designed for bodybuilders, zero-sugar lifestyles, yogurt snobs, or yogurt haters. It's the great equalizer, and we equally enjoyed it and equally (and easily) moved on to the next. It's your standard run-of-the-mill yogurt.\n\n\nSorry, we can't help but ask the obviously leading question: Is this Two Good yogurt too good to be true? Well, after tasting it, we're here to tell you the answer is yes and no. Of course, it makes a big show of its 2 grams of sugar, which isn't something to scoff at. But it wasn't the tastiest yogurt we tried, and as we all know, the taste is crucial. \nWe didn't find the vanilla flavor to be as powerful as we'd like, so it was a touch bland. It also has 2 grams of fat — oh, that's the second \""two,\"" we get it! Basically, it's a solid pick when you spot the 12 grams of protein. However, when we compared it back to back with Oikos Triple Zero, the winner was only too (two?) clear. Nice try!\n\n\nWith an eye-catching 20 grams of protein, Oikos Pro falls right in between the ridiculously high protein count of :ratio PROTEIN (25 grams) and the more commonly found totals of its sister product Oikos Triple Zero (15 grams). While the texture is lightyears better than the :ratio one, it was still suffering just a tiny bit from that same odd chalky flavor, likely due to the whey protein concentrate. \nHere's another indication of the consistency: If you drop fruit on top, the fruit doesn't sink into the yogurt at all, but stays bobbing on top. If this yogurt were a pillow, it would be firm. But with nine essential amino acids, we were feeling strong enough to keep eating. Oikos continues to bring the heat.\n\n\nWe were unable to locate the vanilla version, so plain entered the taste test with some trepidation. For those who love the sour, acidic, and savory flavor of plain Greek yogurt, this 365 by Whole Foods Market one is that. Plain or otherwise, we were all able to tell that 365 Organic delivers the goods. With a solid 16 grams of protein per serving and lots of live and active probiotics, it's a nutrient-dense option you can feel great about purchasing. \nIt's also really easy to purchase, seeing as it's part of the Amazon partnership with Whole Foods Market and can be delivered in two hours with the click of your (Prime account) button. Nothing was seriously wrong with this yogurt, but we were blown away by others, so if you're ready to try Greek yogurt and have a Prime membership? Click away, friends.\n\n\nCome on now, doesn't this product's name, Light + Fit, make it sound just like a Zumba-dancing, leg-warmers-wearing, constantly dieting '90s mom? It's kind of funny, then, that it would taste so much like a dessert. The texture is more similar to a traditional, American-style yogurt — the kind many of us grew up on before the Greek yogurt craze hit like a hurricane — which is nostalgic and nicely smooth. But we did note that it contains some artificial flavors, which definitely contributed to that aforementioned nostalgic, almost birthday cake, vanilla taste. \nIt does have a few fewer grams of protein than some competitors, too, so all of this left it a little lower on the list. But if you really just prefer that American-style yogurt texture and dislike the sourness of traditional Greek yogurt, Light + Fit barely resembles the stark tang of Fage at all.\n\n\nWe loved the concise ingredient list on Siggi's Nonfat Vanilla Bean yogurt: Pasteurized skim milk, organic agave nectar, Madagascar bourbon vanilla, fruit pectin, and live active cultures. That's it. Doesn't the \""Madagascar\"" and \""Bourbon\""-ness of the vanilla make you feel a bit fancier? It certainly pleased our hidden snobby sides. But the ingredients don't tell you that it's Icelandic-style, the traditional yogurt of Iceland that has been made for over 1,000 years. The water found in milk — skim milk, in the case of nonfat yogurt — is siphoned out, leaving only the good stuff. \nSiggi's reveals that it takes approximately four times the milk to make one cup of Siggi's skyr, compared to non-strained yogurt. If you enjoy a more concentrated product boasting a solid 16 grams of protein, this is for you. If you want sweetness and that childhood lunchbox standby, you may not be a skyr person.\n\n\nChobani is almost certainly the biggest name in the protein yogurt business. It's also our go-to yogurt, so it came out of the gate with a slight advantage. The Chobani empire has many different options for you to pick from, and we were delighted to try the Chobani Less Sugar for the first time. \nThe only vanilla option also came with a pinch of cinnamon, and we weren't mad about it. That hint of sweet, savory, and spice all in one is an expert move. We often sprinkle cinnamon on yogurt anyway, so why not infuse it? With 12 grams of protein, we were pleased to discover that the product is the ultimate compromise. A little sugar, a little fat, and a little protein go a long way! It quickly became one of our new favorites.\n\n\nOikos Triple Zero is in it to win it, another worthy contender for the top spot in Oikos's powerful yogurt collection. The vanilla cup has 15 grams of protein, no added sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and no fat. That is, indeed, a lot of zeros. But a close look at the nutrition label reveals one entry that notably is *not* zero: the fiber. \nWith three grams, it was a really enjoyable surprise since fiber is a key to feeling your best — and many yogurts have none at all. Even the bombastic Oikos Pro or self-righteous Two Good is woefully missing the fiber! We thought this one was pretty darn delicious. We were slightly worried that it would have zero taste and texture, especially without the fat, but it ended up being richer and more creamy than expected.\n\n\nFage Total knows itself well and sticks the landing. Case in point: If you buy the whole milk (most truthfully \""Greek\"") variety, there is no vanilla flavor. There are no flavors at all, just plain old yogurt that is not for the faint of heart. We love how irrefutably tangy it is, with a bold sourness that is somehow not off-putting but actually quite magnetic. \nSure, there are nonfat and partial-fat iterations, but if you're making an impossibly moist cake or tzatziki, you want to use this stuff. With 14 grams of protein and a few grams of naturally occurring sugar, it's a highly nutrient-dense decision. But if you're looking for a sweet, vanilla-scented way to ease into your day, Fage is more of a hard launch. Still, we love it for exactly what it is.\n\n\nWe've really hit the vanilla bean jackpot in this taste test. Who knew that so many protein-rich yogurts also had hints of dessert in every nutritious spoonful? While we're not replacing the sweet stuff on top of apple pie a la mode with Skyr any time soon, we are growing ever more appreciative of the wonders of yogurt after enjoying Siggi's. So here's the deal: The whole milk version of Siggi's has four fewer grams of protein than its nonfat counterpart (12 grams in here) but those 4 grams of fat do a lot of good. \nFor one thing, fat is part of a healthy diet (please don't eat reduced-fat cheese, it's just sad) and even helps unlock the nutrients in vegetables, according to Science Daily. For another, as we all know, it just makes things taste better! In this case, (for some reason) it brings out the sweetness in the yogurt, too. So if you can't always tango with the strong tang, try Siggi's with whole milk, not nonfat.\n\n\nWe spy some vanilla bean seeds in this Icelandic Provisions Skyr! From the very first bite, it was giving vanilla bean-laced ice cream notes, which, of course, we enjoyed tremendously. We thought that this pick felt very indulgent while still giving us plenty of protein. Those 15 grams of protein are a delicious incentive, and if you're watching your sugars, the 9 total grams may bump this option down on the list for you. \nThat's basically the only downside, though, so it's safe to say we're major fans of Skyr. The texture was our favorite of all the yogurts tasted so far! And, hey, let's give a big shout-out to the nice live and active cultures, a healthy bonus that isn't to be found in every yogurt on the market.\n\n\nConsidering how front and center the lack of sweetness is advertised on a cup of Chobani Zero Sugar, we felt a little skeptical. Plus, there are no artificial sweeteners, no lactose, no preservatives, no GMO ingredients, no gluten, and six live and active cultures. Is it trying too hard? No, absolutely, not. Somehow, this enchanting little yogurt is delicious, full of real vanilla flavor that seems to make it a tad sweet. It's such a delicious way to eat 11 grams of protein. \nThe texture is ideal, neither too thick nor too thin, and there's still some of that contrasting tang that you want in an \""authentic\""-tasting Greek yogurt. You'd better believe we're on the hunt for the Milk and Cookies flavor! The winner has claimed today's crown. Now let's go and eat something crunchy, okay?\n\n\nTo find the widest selection of high-protein yogurts, we searched many local grocery stores, including Target, Whole Foods, and Harris Teeter. We did not necessarily limit ourselves to yogurt labeled as \""Greek,\"" but found that the majority of yogurts with a generous number of grams of protein were also Greek-style yogurts. \nOf every possible yogurt flavor (and believe us, there are many!), vanilla yogurts are indubitably the most popular, widespread, and easy to find. With this in mind, we tried our best to taste-test only vanilla yogurts to keep the comparisons as equal as possible. However, protein counts do not typically change much across different flavors of the same marketed line of yogurts, so if you prefer other flavors to basic vanilla, feel free to pick them instead.\nWe also made sure that every yogurt was fresh and well within its expiration date, so as to fairly rank them all at the peak of their taste and safety (here's how to tell if your yogurt has gone bad).

Whether you walk for fitness or spend significant time on your feet, you need shoes with quality all-around cushioning and support to prevent fatigue and soreness. A good walking shoe should fit well right away without having to be broken in. Podiatrist Ami Sheth, DPM, FACFAS, says you shouldn't feel any pinching or trouble moving your toes when first wearing walking shoes. Shoe styles with a wide range of sizes, including half sizes and widths, will help you find the best fit for you.\n\n To find the best walking shoes on the market, we tested 50+ pairs in Verywell's Testing Lab and in the real world. We spent more than 160 hours wearing and walking in each shoe on pavement, trails, and the treadmill. Then, we evaluated each pair based on key features, including fit, responsiveness, cushioning, and value. Another reason to trust us? A certified running coach from our Review Board reviewed the claims in this article for physiological accuracy and signed off on any claims surrounding how to evaluate a walking shoe's different features.\n\nWide toe box\nLightweight and breathable\nGreat for all foot shapes\nMay not have enough arch support\n Weight: 9.2 ounces | Closure: Slip-on with laces | Materials: Knit upper, rubber sole | Cushioning Type: EVA foam | Our Overall Rating: 4.9/5\n\n Best for wearers of all fitness levels who need a well-cushioned shoe with plenty of wiggle room.\n\n Adidas' Ultraboost Light boasts exceptional comfort, lightweight breathability, springy responsiveness, and solid stability, making it an easy top pick. The fit is spot-on and what we expected when ordering true to size. We love that the convenient slip-on style also has laces, especially if your narrower foot needs a more fitted upper. Still, the stretchy, breathable upper also gives enough room for wide feet. And thanks to the wide toe box, we could comfortably splay our toes without worrying about blisters or chafing.\n\n During test walks, we found the shoes kept our feet secure and stable—no risk of ankle rolling here. We also appreciated the supportive midsole, which provides great shock absorption and springy responsiveness. We walked faster, with smoother transitions, in these lightweight shoes. The cushioning is bouncy and plush, and we noticed the shoes were just as springy after a month of testing. Overall, these shoes are well worth the investment.\n\n Also available in men's sizes at Amazon and Adidas.\n\n\""Sneakers are so hard for me to find a great pair, and these are perfect in my opinion - comfortable, stylish, and lightweight enough that I actually want to walk more when I wear them.\"" —Kelsey Chapman, Verywell Fit product tester\nVerywell Fit / Kelsey Chapman\nVerywell Fit / Kelsey Chapman\nLightweight and breathable\nExcellent shock absorption\nGood traction\nMay be too rigid for some\n Weight: 10.5 ounces | Closure: Lace-up | Materials: Synthetic and mesh upper, rubber sole | Cushioning Type: Foam insole, GEL cushioning system in heel | Our Overall Rating: 5/5\n\n Best if you need a supportive, inexpensive shoe for plantar fasciitis or other foot pain.\n\n Asics' GEL-Venture 9 Running Shoe is a solid, budget-friendly shoe that supports exercise and all-day wear. During testing, we found that the gel cushioning offers excellent shock absorption on treadmills, pavement, grass, and crushed gravel, especially in the heel area. One tester, who has plantar fasciitis, felt so supported in these shoes that she didn't need additional condition-specific inserts. Plus, the shoes fit true to size and feel snug, with plenty of room in the toe box for added stability.\n\n The heel is slightly elevated, which relieves pressure and pain on our feet. And the solid arch support, springy cushioning, and slight rocker design promote effortless transitions. We felt like we could keep going on long walks without our feet getting tired. We're also impressed with the durable, grippy outsole, which provides reliable traction, even when walking in wet conditions.\n\n Also available in women's sizes at Amazon and Asics.\n\n\""They are the best shoes I have ever used right out of the box that provide immediate relief and support for plantar fasciitis without requiring any custom or expensive orthopedic inserts.\"" —Matt Harper, Verywell Fit product tester\nVerywell Fit / Allison Vancura\nVerywell Fit / Allison Vancura\nVerywell Fit / Allison Vancura\nWater-repellent\nSuitable for walking or running\nThick, plush cushioning\nPricier compared to other options\n Weight: 10.1 ounces | Closure: Lace-up | Materials: Textile and synthetic upper, rubber outsole | Cushioning Type: Foam | Our Overall Rating: 5/5\n\n Best if you prefer thick, pillow-like cushioning and plenty of shock absorption for long walks.\n\n Comfortable and versatile, Brooks' Glycerin GTS 21 Shoes are a clear choice for our men’s top pick. When we first tried them on, we immediately noticed the thick, plush, well-cushioned midsole. And we were impressed by the fit, which is snug in all the right places while offering plenty of room in the toe box. We tested the GTS 20, but the 21 has similar features, plus two more millimeters of added foam and a more breathable upper. They're also available in wide sizes if you have wide feet or need more room for orthotics.\n\n During testing, the shoe's responsive padding supported our ankles and knees. We felt no knee pain, and the shock absorption was highly protective. Although they're designed for running, we also enjoy wearing these sneakers while walking and doing cardio classes. The light, breathable upper is also fairly water-repellent: After getting caught in the rain, we were pleasantly surprised by how quickly these dried without feeling soggy or weighed down.\n\n Also available in women's sizes at Amazon and Brooks.\n\n\""I feel very stable wearing these shoes. I've worn them on all terrains—cushioned gym floor, cement, sand, gravel, and up and down wood stairs. These make my ankle feel particularly stable (as someone with narrow feet and ankles, this is always a point of concern).\"" —Ivy Ford, Verywell Fit product tester\nVerywell Fit / Tamara Staples\nVerywell Fit / Tamara Staples\nVerywell Fit / Tamara Staples\nTwo width options\nWide toe box\nAmple shock absorption\nBulky for some\n Weight:  8.7 ounces | Closure: Slip-on with laces | Materials:  Mesh upper, rubber outsole | Cushioning Type: EVA foam | Our Overall Rating: 4.9/5\n\n Best for wearers who need a super plush yet lightweight shoe designed specifically for walking.\n\n Made for high-performance walking, Ryka's Devotion X Walking Shoe is a solid pick if you're on your feet all day, walk long distances, or live a busy lifestyle. The anatomically shaped insole provides ample arch and heel support, keeping our feet comfortable and fatigue-free all day long. Plus, the rubber outsole delivers enough traction and protection to trek on all types of terrain safely. We tested these shoes on sand, cement, sidewalks, grass, and gym floors.\n\n During test walks, our feet felt supported, with no instability in the feet, ankles, or knees. We were able to wear these shoes for hours without any pain. We love the soft yet firm cushioning, which provides great shock absorption and impact protection without feeling bulky. And despite all that cushioning, the lightweight shoes promote quick and effortless transitions. We also liked how breathable they felt—we tested in hot, humid weather and our feet never got sweaty.\n\n\""From the moment I put the shoe on it's like it belonged or was made for my feet. My knees, ankles, toes, were all feeling supported.\"" —Sahara Borja, Verywell Fit product tester\nVerywell Fit / Sahara Borja\nVerywell Fit / Sahara Borja\nVerywell Fit / Sahara Borja\nAvailable in four widths\nAPMA Seal of Acceptance\nVery stable\nMay feel clunky\n Weight:  7.4 ounces | Closure: Lace-up | Materials: Mesh upper, rubber outsole | Cushioning Type: Moderate foam | Our Overall Rating: 4.9/5\n\n Best for wearers that need a stable shoe with extra support for daily fitness walks.\n\n New Balance shoes are known for being super supportive, and the Fresh Foam X 880v14 is no exception. They feature neutral cushioning and a wide heel that add even more support. We tested the previous version of the shoe, and this version is slightly firmer for greater stability and lighter for a more effortless stride. During test walks, we felt like we were walking on air in these shoes. Plus, they're available in four widths and carry the APMA Seal of Acceptance for promoting foot health.\n\n When we first tried the shoes on, they fit true to size—hugging our heels but offering plenty of room in the toe box. One of our testers, who suffers from plantar fasciitis, felt no pain at the end of the day, even without special inserts. However, we appreciate that these shoes are roomy enough to accommodate inserts for plantar fasciitis or other foot ailments. We also love that they provided just enough bounce and shock absorption to make fast walking and light jogging even more enjoyable. \n\n Also available in men's sizes at New Balance and Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\n\""My feet, ankles and knees felt supported when I wore the shoes with out my speical inserts. I wore the shoes all day and my feet didn't really hurt at the end of the day.\""—Mary Amadeo, Verywell Fit product tester\nVery breathable\nGood heel support\nFirm yet flexible\nLaces may untie\nSome prefer plush cushioning\n Weight: 8 ounces | Closure: Lace-up | Materials: Synthetic upper, leather and rubber outsole | Cushioning Type: EVA foam | Our Overall Rating: 4.7/5\n\n Best if you have wide or extra-wide feet and prefer firm arch support.\n\n If you have wide feet, you need a shoe that can accommodate your foot shape to be comfortable without pinching or squeezing. Vionic's Tokyo Shoes are wide enough to make wide feet feel good. They have ample cushioning in the heel that keeps us comfy on treadmills, trails, and more. We also found the heel cup to be very supportive and snug, with a slight elevation that takes the pressure off the balls of our feet.\n\n During testing, the firm but flexible insole provided additional support and stability throughout our walks. One tester, who is prone to plantar fasciitis, discovered that the shoe's cushioning, particularly in the heel area, offered excellent protection against symptoms. We also noticed that the curved sole promotes smooth transitions to the next step. And the mesh upper is one of the most breathable we've seen, keeping us cool, dry, and extra-comfy on long walks. \n\n\""The shoes were comfortable and ready to walk around immediately; no break-in period required. The shoe is wide enough, so there really wouldn't be any tight areas to worry about. The heels are elevated but I did not feel any excess pressure on the balls of my feet; the weight and impact of my step was adequately absorbed by the sole.\""—Hildara Araya-Gonzalez, Verywell Fit product tester\nVerywell Fit / Hildara Araya-Gonzalez\nVerywell Fit / Hildara Araya-Gonzalez\nVerywell Fit / Hildara Araya-Gonzalez\nExcellent lateral support\nGood traction\nComes in two widths\nLess responsive than other options\n Weight: 9.2 ounces | Closure: Lace-up | Materials: Mesh upper, rubber sole | Cushioning Type: Foam midsole cushioning | Our Overall Rating: 4.6/5\n\n Best for hikers who need a rugged shoe for lots of outdoor walks on varied trails and terrain.\n\n Altra's Lone Peak 8 trail shoe is our top pick for hiking offering excellent support and cushioning. The fit is near perfect: It hugs our feet in all the right places without pinching or squeezing anywhere. The shoes’ padding feels extremely comfortable during walks, providing good energy return and putting a spring in our step for long hikes. And the zero-drop design let's you keep maximum contact with the ground with every step. We also appreciate that the upper is made of rip-stop mesh to protect from debris.\n\n This pair has maximum lateral stability, thanks to platform inserts that position your heel and forefoot in the correct alignment to help correct rolling or overpronation. We're also impressed by the shoe’s slip-resistant outsole, which provides good traction on wet and dry surfaces. We love that it has a roomy fit and comes in two different widths, so it can accommodate orthotics or insoles for flat feet if needed.\n\n Also available in men's sizes at Amazon and REI.\n\n\""The cushioning feels great, it's a decent amount without making the shoe bulky or heavy.\"" —Shane Huffstead, Verywell Fit product tester\nVerywell Fit / Jaylyn Pruitt\nVerywell Fit / Jaylyn Pruitt\nVerywell Fit / Jaylyn Pruitt\nEasy to clean\nVery stable\nSustainably made\nNot very breathable\nTongue may feel too rigid\n Weight: Not stated | Closure: Lace-up | Materials: Faux leather upper, rubber sole | Cushioning Type: Sugar-cane based foam | Our Overall Rating: 4.9\n\n Best for wearers who need durable shoes that will stand up to daily wear.\n\n Allbirds Plant Pacer Shoes have a sleek style and are easy to clean, thanks to their faux leather upper, making them an easy choice for everyday wear. They fit well, with plenty of room in the toe box, and have comfortable cushioning. The inside is soft and snug enough to wear these shoes comfortably with or without socks. We also love that Allbirds is committed to reducing its environmental impact and using renewable resources for its products (including this shoe).\n\n The insole is removable if you need to add inserts, like for flat feet or plantar fasciitis. And the balanced cushioning and shock absorption are ideal for long days on your feet or running errands. During testing, we noted that the solid, flat sole is also flexible, making these comfy for lots of walking. Our feet didn't feel sore or painful at all at the end of the day.\n\n\""I had absolutely no instability occur throughout the testing period.

The fit is true to size, and our feet didn't slide around inside them. We love the convenient slip-on design, making it easy to step in and out of these shoes quickly. One of our testers suffers from bunions and found these shoes to be wide enough not to irritate or chafe during weeks of walking.\n\n During testing, we noticed that these felt breathable and stable, with plenty of impact protection for long walks and hours on our feet. Another plus: We found these shoes to be quite sleek and stylish. \n\n Also available in men's sizes at Kizik.\n\n\""I love the fit. When I first put them on I instantly knew they were going to be my new favorite, go-to pair of walking shoes.

One of our testers, who usually drags her feet during walks, found the shoe's significant rocker shape actively propelled her forward with a bouncy feel. We found our feet stayed firmly in place inside these shoes, and we appreciated the heel support.\n\n The shoe's midsole cushioning felt soft and supportive, keeping our feet stable during short and long walks. The wide and roomy toe box, which offers ample room for toes to splay out, also helped to keep our feet stable. Even with all the built-in stability, the shoes have a good bounce-back feel with each step. And we found the lightweight and breathable shoes to be super comfortable, too—like a spa for your feet, one tester said.\n\n Also available in men's sizes at Amazon and Nike.\n\n\""This shoe is extremely effective at propelling the walker to the next step (they're almost like the rocking chair version of moon shoes, in a way).

When we tried them on, we appreciated the true-to-size, completely customizable fit. The shoes come with an orthotic insole, fitting spacers, and an arch booster insert so that you can find the right level of support. We especially appreciate the hands-free, slip-in design that only requires you to adjust the laces once.\n\n After logging many miles in these shoes, we never experienced any knee or ankle instability. The cushioned, supportive insole provides ample shock absorption and quick heel-to-toe transitions. Most importantly, the shoes are super comfortable. One tester, who has bunions and plantar fasciitis, said these are her new go-to walking shoes.\n\n\""The shoes feel optimally squishy but not sloppy or too sunk in. Because these shoes are designed to be able to slip on and off hands-free, the heel has more structure to it yet maintains flexibility. There is a good amount of cushioning around the whole ankle and tongue of the shoe which helps with the flexible hold of the shoe while you walk.\"" —Brie Goldman, Verywell Fit product tester\nVerywell Fit / Brie Goldman\nVerywell Fit / Brie Goldman\nBudget-friendly\nMachine washable\nBreathable upper\nLaces aren't adjustable\n Weight:  Not listed | Closure: Slip-on with laces | Materials:  Mesh upper, rubber outsole | Cushioning Type: Foam | Our Overall Rating: 4.9/5\n\n Best for wearers looking for an easy shoe for daily walking.\n\n Whether you live a busy lifestyle or take your sneakers on the go, purchasing a pair of slip-ons can save you time and (in this case) money. Skechers' Go Walk Flex Alani shoes are budget-friendly and offer all-day comfort and fatigue-free feet. One tester even compared wearing these shoes to walking effortlessly on a cloud. And we like that once we get our foot in the shoe, the upper is form-fitting for a snug feel. Plus, these shoes are easy to care for because they're machine washable.\n\n Despite having a limited range of sizes, we found a true-to-size fit that hugged our feet in all the right places. Thanks to the wide toe box, our toes had plenty of room to splay, which helped with overall stability. During test walks, the thick, supportive, and cushioned midsole also helped keep our feet stable and deliver shock absorption and impact protection on all types of terrains. We found that the curved design of the shoe helped with speedy and seamless transitions between strides, propelling us to walk even faster than usual.\n\n\""Oh my gosh these were so comfortable!

Waterproof shoes are a great choice if you live in a wet climate or hike near bodies of water, and an essential feature when trekking on wet surfaces is a grippy outsole. Luckily, we found that these waterproof shoes offer excellent traction to prevent any slipping and sliding.\n\n During test walks, the lightweight cushioning provided support without weighing our feet down. We love the excellent shock absorption, solid arch support, and springy midsole responsiveness, which added to the shoes' overall comfort. We also appreciate the breathable knit upper, which is waterproof but still allows for much-needed airflow to prevent overheating and odor.\n\n Also available in men's sizes at Vessi.\n\n\""These are very responsive!

While these three ultimately fell short in one or more key categories, we did find some noteworthy features.\n\n To develop our best walking shoes list, we tested over 50 pairs of sneakers outside on roads, trails, and on the treadmill during short and long walks—totaling over 160 hours of testing. We also ask our experts for their input on what features to look for in comfortable walking shoes. Our on-site podiatrist, Diana Levin Valencia, DPM, helped evaluate the construction of each shoe. As we continue to test and evaluate walking shoes, we keep these key criteria in mind:\n\nVerywell Fit / Tamara Staples\n We spoke to four podiatrists to better understand what key features to look for in a walking shoe. Each podiatrist also told us which shoe brands and features work best for different foot types and issues.\n\nVerywell Fit / Tamara Staples\n The short answer is that yes, running shoes can be used for walking. Running shoes are usually lightweight to allow for quick movement and they have more cushioning, while walking shoes are typically heavier to help maintain stability and have a little more flex in the forefoot to push off with.\n\n In general, walking shoes last about 350 to 500 miles before the support, cushioning, and shock absorption wear out, leaving you susceptible to injury. For most people, that’s about six to eight months if you wear them regularly.\n\n Quality walking shoes can cost between $70 and $160 or more. Pricier shoes will typically be more durable and are often made with features to help walkers with specific issues, like flat feet or plantar fasciitis. Budget-friendlier walking shoes are better suited for healthy walkers with no specific foot or gait issues.\n\nVerywell Fit / Tamara Staples\n As a running coach, marathon runner, and fitness writer, Christine Luff, ACE-CPT, has spent years researching and recommending running and walking shoes.

And these shoes do get the job done in many cases.\nBut when your feet start craving more comfort and support in your daily walks, it’s time to consider a dedicated walking shoe. \nWe have walked in the walking shoes, cut them in half, ripped them apart, and used many lab instruments to test, measure, and assess 20+ parameters, and all this to help you find the best one. Understanding that people may expect different things from their walking shoes, we have selected top picks in different categories.\nWe are a team of shoe fanatics who have dived into the nitty-gritty details of numerous walking shoes to deliver you the most comprehensive reviews. What's more, we bought every shoe with our own funds!\nOur reviews would not be complete without our lab tests. Subjecting shoes to over 30 different tests, we get rare and valuable data that cannot be provided by a few days or even weeks of regular wear testing. Flexibility, breathability, and toebox width are just a few examples!\nBut it doesn't stop there: we delve even deeper by cutting the shoes in half to obtain other quantitative data, such as stack heights and midsole softness.\nMotiva is Nike’s first dedicated walking shoe and it impressed us greatly in our lab and wear tests, making it our top choice among all walking shoes we've tested so far! Its design stands out from the rest, yet its luxurious cushion, smooth transitions, and robust outsole make each walk truly enjoyable.\nWe felt like we were on cloud nine as we stepped into the thick and squishy cushion. The stack rises to an above-average 34.9/25.6 mm with a light composition that provides exceptional relief. Our durometer confirms it’s 40.0% softer than average. The wavy sole also levels up the compression for added underfoot protection.\nAt first glance, Motiva's pronounced rocker stands out. However, wearing the shoe amplifies its effect, offering seamless heel-to-toe transitions with each stride. To maintain the forward momentum, we expect the midsole to be quite stiff. Our bend test confirms it’s 43.1% stiffer than average.\nMotiva shows unwavering support from dry to wet pavements, offering traction with its waffle-like pattern. It barely shows any wear after our tests so we expect it to last hundreds of miles. Motiva combines a 21.4% tougher-than-average 92.0 HC outsole with a thicker-than-average 3.0 mm rubber, cementing its durability.\nVisually, we noticed the sole tends to crease easily because of its softness. However, we believe this won't significantly impact its performance, except for heavier runners who might experience premature cushion compression.\nAllbirds Tree Runners is unparalleled in being the superior walking shoe out there and its maximum-extent functionality is what won us over. For all-day wear, work, travel, and everything in between, this walking shoe is definitely the most comfortable. As if that isn’t enough of a reason, Tree Runners also stands out in sustainability and easy-to-slip-on convenience!\nA forever and a day didn’t feel like a long time when we were in Allbirds Tree Runners. One reason we found for our painless long walks is its delightfully firm midsole. We validated what we felt through our durometer, which reflected a 29.6 HA hardness that’s slightly softer than the 31.2 HA average. \nAnother factor that got us through the day with ceaseless comfort is the shoe’s breathability. While Allbirds Tree Runners only scored 3/5 on our breathability test, our bright light revealed its very porous upper, which allowed our feet to feel superb airflow. Correspondingly, this shoe is also super lightweight. With a weight of 8.6 oz (245g), it is 22% lighter than average.\nAlthough our caliper measured the shoe’s insole to be 7.2 mm, which, by the way, is 38% more cushioned than average, we still felt like it lacked arch support. That being said, we do not recommend this pair to people who require extra supportive shoes.\nIn our search for the best walking shoe for standing all day, we looked for a shoe that feels amazingly soft yet secure on foot. Based on our time spent in the shoe and in the lab where we thoroughly tested it, the Hoka Transport is just that! It does all this with its perfectly balanced cushioning which comes in a very secure package.\nWe found it perfect for spending full days on our feet. It's plush underfoot but not squishy at all. Our lab tests confirmed this: we pressed a durometer against its midsole foam and it scored 21.9 HA, making it 23% softer than an average walking shoe while still providing a sufficiently firm platform to stand on.\nWhat seals the deal when it comes to this well-balanced cushioning is that we felt no wobbling! No wonder, given that it is 45% stiffer than the average walking shoe. We tested this with our force gauge that showed 30.4N when we bent the shoe to 90 degrees. The semi-gusseted tongue and relatively stiff heel counter also helped us feel more secure in the Hoka Transport.\nWe do not recommend Hoka Transport to those who live in warm climates. As shown in our breathability test, this shoe is less breathable than average. Hello, sweaty feet!\nCountless hours of lab and wear tests allowed us to discover the walking shoe with the best arch support: the Skechers Arch Fit 2.0. As its name suggests, our feet enjoyed the level of support this shoe brings, both in comfort and stability. It surprisingly preserves in-shoe pleasure despite its rigid elements and affordable $90 price.\nOur arches are well-cradled inside the AF2’s generous stack. Our caliper reveals above-average measurements, notably its whopping 39.2 mm heel that erased any hint of the ground. To our amazement, it maintains a stable ride thanks to its non-squishy composition. Our durometer confirms it’s 21.6% denser than average, preventing uneven collapsing of the foam.\nAllowing us to distribute our weight and secure our footing is the wide platform of the shoe which is 114.5/90.9 mm in the forefoot and heel. Enhancing surefootedness is the stiff midsole, which includes flex grooves in strategic areas so that it isn’t too rigid. Upon counterchecking with our bend test, AF2 stands 15.7% more resilient than average.\nHowever, its lack of durability, specifically in the toebox, heel padding, and outsole, limits the shoe’s lifespan. We recommend exercising caution with these areas as they demonstrated minimal resistance against our Dremel.\nOn Cloud 5 really set the mark for being an outstanding travel walking shoe, thanks to its wanderlust-ready characteristics! Testing the shoe for a considerable amount of time, we learned that it almost feels like we are walking barefoot: natural strides, terrific airflow, and weightless trips all throughout the day.\nOur on-foot roam around with Cloud 5 was just exquisite because we could walk in it with little to no effort. In our lab, we found that it was certainly flexible when we subjected the shoe to bending using our digital force gauge. It hardly resisted bending at a 19.8N force. This might be 10% less flexible than the average, but it granted us fluid foot motions. \nEven when we got out on sunny days, Cloud 5 took care of preventing or drying off sweat on our feet. We looked into it by flashing a bright light to the upper and discovered it is heavily perforated, especially around the toe box, allowing a smooth air passage. Much like air, the Cloud 5 also weighed next to nothing, as shown by our scale. It was 7.94 oz (225g), which was 12.1% lighter than others.\nHowever, we realized that Cloud 5 was more fitting for occasional travels only and not frequent ones because it wasn’t the toughest shoe we tried on. Actually, after using it for a while, we noticed wear in the toebox area. We suggest being easy on Cloud 5 or sporting a more durable shoe if you can’t help being all out on your trips.\nOnly one pair got us head over heels when we tested for the ultimate slip-resistant walking shoe and that is Hoka Bondi SR. On the bottom surface, it creates an exceptional amount of friction against glassy surfaces that eradicates any chance of missteps and mishaps. Inside, it’s so inviting that we never want to wear anything but Bondi!\nTo learn more about the non-skid ability of Bondi, we made contact between our durometer and the outsole. With a 73.1 HC hardness flashed on the device, we learned two things: It is equally soft as the average and this allowed the shoe to cling hard on tiles and other smooth floors.\nAside from the slip protection, we also got our feet a home whenever we were out racking up the distance. We once again utilized our durometer, but this time we pressed it to the midsole, giving us a 20.4 HA softness, which is 20% softer than average. We also measured the tongue’s padding and a whopping 11.1 mm was recorded by our caliper. Not only did it surpass the average by 177.5% but the overall padding and cushioning rendered us more than satisfied, comfort-wise.\nToo bad the Bondi’s upper did not emit the smoke we filled up its interior. Accordingly, we rated its breathability a 1/5, so if you plan on getting Bondi, make sure to use it bearing this information. Otherwise, we recommend choosing a more air-circulated pair.\nAt first glance, it’s obvious that KEEN WK400 is the best-rockered walking shoe. Yet what reestablished its title is its performance in our actual walks and lab tests. It smoothly propels us forward, encouraging us to get our steps in by supporting us with a mindblowing amount of cushioning and a robust outsole.\nIts striking feature is its KEEN CURVE, similar to a rocking chair. A stiff full-length plate sits beneath the midsole to retain its rocker shape and to stabilize our strides as we move forward. Our bend test reveals it's 60.8% more rigid than average.\nWith its one-of-a-kind midsole, we couldn’t wait to measure the cut-in-half shoe. Our caliper reveals a whopping 45.7 mm heel, offering generous cushioning for a zero-pain experience. Paired with a 24.3 mm forefoot, the drop results in a never-before-seen 21.4 mm. Such a high drop translates to smooth forward rolls and significantly less pressure on our lower legs. Further making the whole experience enjoyable is its softer-than-average and bouncy foam.\nUnderfoot, we found a very supportive and durable lugged outsole—12.7% harder and 2.4 mm thicker than the average walking shoe. All our lab results point to its toughness, which means it can handle moderate trails too. \nUnfortunately, it’s also one of the heaviest walking shoes we’ve lab-tested. At 13.4 oz (381g), it sits 40.1% above the average.\nFirst of all, think of how you are going to wear your pair of walking shoes most of the time.\nHere are the three most common categories of walking footwear based on their intended use:\nShoes in this range are meant for walking and standing all day long, be it for leisure, errands, fitness, casual outings, or a trip to Disneyland.\n\nThey will keep you comfortable on concrete or any other urban surface, as well as cobblestone, and not too rocky trails.\nAdditionally, you can consider running shoes designed for walking to expand your options.\n\n\nThese are lightweight, airy shoes that are barely noticeable on foot. Most of them have a slip-on design, which makes them easy to put on and take off.\n\nThis footwear will cushion your feet in long airport lines, on sightseeing trips, and while meandering around your vacation spot.\n\n\nThese models are meant for the workers of healthcare, food, and other essential industries. They typically come with a leather upper which makes them hard-wearing and easy to maintain.\n\nThe outsole often features a slip-resistant characteristic to keep the wearer sure-footed on dusty and wet tile floors.\n\n\nDo your feet have special needs? \nBe it a diagnosed condition like diabetes or just periodic heel pain, your walking shoe should relieve discomfort and not aggravate it. Here are some general guidelines on what type of footwear to choose for various health issues:\nCan you find your foot arch and pronation type in the pictures below?\n\nDo your shoes tend to wear out on the inner side much faster? Does it feel like your ankles are about to roll over the shoe's sole? If so, most likely you have flat feet and/or overpronation and you need a pair of stability walking shoes.\nHere is how these shoes help your feet and legs:\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nWe assess, torsional rigidity and heel counter stiffness for each shoe in our lab. We also use a caliper to measure the widest parts of the sole.\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\n\n\n*The table is sorted by the torsional rigidity score where 5 is the stiffest.\nA perfect shoe for plantar fasciitis is going to have the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nIn our lab, we measure midsole softness, insole thickness, platform width, heel counter stiffness, and more to pick out the most suitable options for this painful foot condition. Here are the top-rated walking shoes that meet these criteria:\n\n\n*The table is sorted by midsole softness: the lower HA reading stands for softer cushioning.\nIf a bony bump on the big toe joint wouldn't let you live, a walking shoe with the following characteristics will ease your pain:\n\nIn addition to trying each shoe ourselves, we use a caliper to measure their precise toebox widths.\n\nWe measure both the widest part of the forefoot as well as the toebox width near the big toe. The two numbers make it easier to compare toebox tapering across all walking shoes.\n\n\n\nIf you need more options, set the width filter to wide or extra-wide on this catalog page.\nHeavy walkers are going to appreciate the following characteristics in their daily beaters:\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nDisclaimer: These recommendations are based on the general podiatrists’ advice and are not meant as a substitute for professional medical treatment.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Because we are not qualified to recommend footwear for diabetes, we rely on the statements made by the brands themselves.\nNew Balance is among the most popular companies that have certified walking shoes for this condition.\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nFrom our experience, here is what makes these shoes eligible:\nThese shoes are marked with an A5500 code, which makes them subject to compensation by Medicare.\n\n\nKnowing how hard concrete can be on one's feet and footwear, we created a separate category of waking shoes meant for that surface. There are a few key characteristics that walking shoes must meet to get here:\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\n\n\n*Outsole durability shows the depth of the damage left in the shoe's outsole after 22 seconds of Dremel drilling.

We even have a selection of the best running shoes for walking for you to check out. In many ways, running and walking shoes are very similar as both are designed with repetitive forward motion in mind. A lot of beginner runners also start by interchanging jogging and walking and most running shoes accommodate that perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nJust make sure that you are selecting from daily trainers and not speed- and performance-oriented running shoes. The latter have a peculiar design that makes them feel awkward and unstable on slower paces.\nSome walking shoes are so incredibly light that you even forget about having them on your feet!\n\nWe keep track of shoes that weigh less than 9.2 oz (260g) in a men's US size 9 and keep them in a separate catalog of lightweight walking shoes. Here are some of the lightest ones on our roster:\n\n\nSome of these shoes go as far as being minimalist or even barefoot-like. This footwear type is very unique and requires an adaptation period. \n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nOverall, we think that lightweight walking shoes are irreplaceable if you are after the following:\n\nBut there is a dark side to lightweight shoes too as they tend to have:\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nThe choice is simple:\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\nLeather vs. mesh upper: difference in breathability\n\n\nBut there is just no doubt that leather and suede shoes beat their mesh counterparts in wear resistance. Below is the comparison between two shoes after the same Dremel test. For consistency, we apply the tool's sandpaper tip with the same speed (5K RPM) and pressure (3.2N) to all walking shoes for 12 seconds. \nIf you are not a fan of leather shoes, there are alternatives with extra sturdy and tightly woven textile uppers.\n\n\n\n\n        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n\n\n\n\nAny recommendations for sneakers for travel days that involve lots of walking (5-8 miles)? I’ve found my feet start to really ache on museum days especially. I’ve ordered a pair of Vessi sneakers for wet weather (will be good for travel and at home) but I’m not sure about their comfort level for days with a long time on my feet. When not traveling I usually walk home from work, about 2.5 miles so looking for something that will work for that too, though I’m certainly not too proud to rock the full Working Girl look…black tights + white sneakers? Why not!\nBefore my last trip, I got Allbirds…I like the look of them, but they didn't really hold up on those days with lots of walking (fortunately I was in Paris without much of an agenda so it just resulted in more cafe time…not exactly the end of the world). They’re definitely on their last legs now, so need something new before Amsterdam in May…recs welcome!\nWell, what works for me may not work for you.   I wear Altra zero-drop athletic shoes.  I generally get the Lone Peak model if there is a color that is not too jarring to me.  I've walked as much as 8-10 miles in these and they are perfect for my feet.  You may not want the zero-drop minimalist platform.  IF you decide to try them out you need to work your way into them well before your vacation.\nI also recommend exploring MELT Method balls - I have the hand and foot kit.  These are soft and hard balls, 2 different sizes that you roll or press into your feet in a specific sequence.  The developer, Sue Hitzman, says they rehydrate the fascia of the feet.  I bring them with me every trip and do use them at night after a long day of walking even if my feet aren't stiff.\nYou may receive as many replies as there are brands of footwear. Read the replies and pay attention to the reason why a poster prefers a brand and match your priorities. I need a narrow heel, adequate toe box, laces, good support, and grip on wet surfaces. I prefer a shoe that does not scream that I just ran a race or came from the gym. I want to walk/stand all day then dine at a nice restaurant without looking too touristy. My Munro Traveler is my only pair without laces that I am certain will not come off my feet if I trip/fall. My Ecco and Vionic sneakers have taken me on many long miles/hours of standing and walking on uneven surfaces and hard museum floors and stairs. To make them less sporty/casual I swap out the white laces for a color that matches the sneaker. Make your purchase well in advance to allow yourself time to break in the new shoes.\nI agree with you on the Allbirds and I’m glad I walked in mine first instead of just taking them with me. I like my Brooks Ghost which I walk in a lot at home. I’m more concerned about comfort for long distances on my feet than looking touristy in Athletic shoes. You might go into some place like REI and try several types of walking shoes to find what best fits your feet.\nEvery foot is different, so try on ass many as you can.  For me, Saucony and OnCloud are both great for many miles of walking.  I have worn Saucony for half and full marathons (walking) and they always serve me well.  The OnClouds have gone on various trips with me and they are very comfy as well.  I like the OC's as they are water resistant vs the Saucony's that I have.\nI agree that you are going to get many many suggestions and every one of them will be different from each poster.\nThe shoes you have mentioned aren’t really known for being extra supportive, at least from what I have read.  For long walking trips I take Brooks Ghost model # whichever one is most current, I think they just came out with #16. I always buy the black one with white sole. These shoes accommodate orthotics well, have a roomy enough toe box and can take the 20,000 + steps a day that tours throw at you. \nHappy hunting!\nI walk 10 miles a day and wear New Balance shoes.  They have shoes specifically designed for walking, not running.  They have several versions  of their walking shoes at a variety of price points.  They are so comfortable that even when I complete my 10 miles I sometimes keep them on.\nI have worn running shoes made by Asics and Mizuno. Both are great. Now, it's hard for me to go back to other shoes.\nI have wide feet and wear Rykas for daily 2-3 mile walks on a mix of concrete and dirt paths. For a comfortable pair of hiking shoes I love Nortive 8 light weight hiking shoes available on Amazon. I sized up to 7 from 6.5. I found them comfortable for both urban and trail hikes since they have extra padding in the inside as well as lug soles. I've worn them on 5-7 mile hikes without foot pain.\nAnother vote for checking out OnCloud, which are even considered stylish right now! I am also an Allbirds fan so maybe our tastes align. I have terrible old buniony feet, a huge walker wherever I am and average 15,000 daily steps, often more.\n    The sizing is consistent in OnCloud and the toe box wide enough for my needs. I use the bouncier thicker sole version for running and their \""everyday\"" styles otherwise.\nLook at Trail Runners.  They are a cross between a running shoe and a hiking shoe and they work really well on wet pavement and cobblestones.\nI currently wear On trail runners.  I liked this pair of On Cloudventure trail runners so much that I bought a second pair.\nhttps://www.on.com/en-us/products/cloudventure-32/womens/black-cobble-shoes-32.99257\nRegardless, you need to try shoes on.  Do you have an REI near you?  I bought some AllBirds over the internet during the pandemic and found them so incredibly uncomfortable that I gave them to Goodwill.  I know some people love them, but they didn’t work for me.  I won’t buy shoes I haven’t tried on anymore.\n\""I won’t buy shoes I haven’t tried on anymore.\""\nI SO understand this, which is why I'm a devoted Zappos fan.  I can get free shipping and free returns with them.  I've not found a local place who stocks shoes in Size 11 (-->mentally insert eye roll emoji here!).  Men's shoe lasts are too wide in the heel if they fit in the forefoot.  If I'm ordering a new brand I order 2 sizes at the same time so I can compare as you would in a brick and mortar store.\nI am currently on a trip in Spain walking 8-10 miles a day. I have  been wearing Brooks and am not having any issues.\nLast year in London I was wearing Nikes  also walking 8-10 miles and developed plantar fasciitis.\nHi Maggie…I just want to comment on the Vessi sneakers.  I bought some for an Ireland trip last fall…I wanted them to serve a dual purpose of walking long days with possible wet weather.  They felt wonderful trying them on, and were super supportive on our trip…but…I wish I had worn them longer at home.  The upper heel area is very high, really rubbed on the back of my ankle (waaay up there!) and I had to use multiple layers of bandaids to get through the day.  Not sure if all Vessi shoes are similar or maybe just that particular style.  And I don’t ever have issues with shoes….just a reminder to really test things out at home.\nOn the other hand, my Allbirds ballet flats got me through some very long days in Dublin and are coming with me to Italy next month. Go figure!\nHokas! They have so many styles but I'm on my fourth pair of Hoka Kawanna. Good luck!\nAlso an Allbirds fan, but they just don't last, which is an issue I am finding with \""sustainable\"" shoes and socks. The soles of the wool and tree runners are also pretty bad on slick surfaces, although the trail runners are an exception (and seem to last better, both for the uppers and the soles). I bring wool runners just for lower mileage days, shorter walks to dinner, etc. I also usually bring my Remonte Liv hightops - they are a leather sneaker, water-resistant, and look a little dressier than trail shoes. Great tread for cobbles too. I now have a pair of Merrell Morphlite sneakers to add to the mix, which are surprisingly comfy - Merrell's don't normally fit me well, but these are nice and cushy. Not a big tread, but should be OK for cobbles, I think. Also have a pair of Saucony Peregrines, a trail shoe which I am really liking for hikes but probably would not pack for city walking.\nAs Pam said upthread...\""what works for me may not work for you.\"" So I won't make any assumptions.\nNew Balance is what I wear and have been delighted with. They were recommended by my podiatrist after he diagnosed me with various foot problems. He suggested I wear nothing but New Balance, so I have several pairs. \nMy podiatrist only wears New Balance so that tells you how much he believes in them.\nThey have been great for pounding the pavement walking around London and the English countryside and standing for long periods of time in museums. My feet never hurt and are never tired.\nSo I do suggest you try a pair of New Balance.\nI have found that my Dansko Paisley shoes (lace up) are more comfortable on museum days than sneakers.  I think the firmer sole provides more support on the concrete or marble floors.  I wore them all around Rome on our RS Rome Tour last year and my feet and legs held up well.\nThanks for all the suggestions! I don’t know why I forgot about brooks…have had good luck with those in the past. Will definitely look into the OnClouds too. The melt method balls sound like they would absolutely help. \nI’m so curious about the Vessi’s…seems like they would be great for wet days, but I wish I could have tried them on before spending the money! It’s free returns, but that’s still a pain. They’ll be here in a week…I’ll let you all know what I think & if I keep them. \nI have a heel spur and have had surgery on my toe joint (where a bunion would be)...so shoes really matter for me. I bought two pairs of Hoka Bondi 8s after doing a lot of research. So far they are good for me.\nI recommend going to a running shoe store for a fitting. They will analyze your gait and recommend the best shoes for your feet. I've been doing this the past couple years and it's made all the difference. \nSkechers Arch Fit Citi Drive sneakers have seen me through 2 years of intense walking . Last year 6 to 14 miles a day in Italy. No break in needed! At least not for me.  They not the most long lasting but the arch fit support is great and it has good shock absorption which really protected my back and an ankle that can b cranky.  I have a narrow foot and was surprised how well they fit.  Never a blister.  Also they are leather (more or less) which is helpful on rainy days.  I spray waterproofing on new leather walking shoes before I wear them also.  Keeps feet dry in rain and they stay cleaner. Might want to give them a look.\nLook at the Keen brand of shoes.  \nNot cheap but cured me of plantar fasciitis so I swear by the brand.  See if either the Explore or the waterproof Terradora ll are of any interest. \nFor long-distance walking and travel days, consider brands like Brooks, Nike, or New Balance. Models like the Brooks Ghost, Nike Air Zoom Pegasus, or New Balance Fresh Foam series are known for their comfort and support. Look for features like cushioning, arch support, and breathability. Additionally, consider adding gel insoles for extra comfort. As for style, black tights paired with white sneakers can definitely work for a chic yet practical look!\nMaggieD, if you're in Boston I can recommend getting sized and checking out walking shoes at Marathon Sports. They've been incredibly kind and patient with me even though I am very clearly not a marathon runner, and the pairs of Brooks sneakers I've bought from them have kept me comfortable for hours of walking in Spain and on domestic trips. \n@Naomi, that is exactly what I did! And should have just done from the start. Wound up with saucony’s this time. Of course when I was first looking it was the actual marathon so you couldn’t get near there, but once again they were super helpful & I got to use the fancy new foot measuring machine for the first time. \nFor anyone wondering, the first pair of Vessi’s were too big, replacement should arrive tomorrow, hopefully before I have to head to the airport. But I don’t love the idea of breaking in new shoes while traveling, so I’ll probably just bring my ratty old sneakers for rainy days. \nJust back from 3 weeks in France, Belgium and the Netherlands and I wore my Hoka Clifton 9’s everyday (miles of walking everyday) and never gave my feet one thought the entire time. Hoka’s never require break in time and they have great cushioning for all the cobblestones and are lightweight. I took backup waterproof Merrells,  and never wore them. Lots of people on our tour had on Hokas. \nI just got back from a Paris and the Heart of France. We did 5 days pre tour in Paris. On one day I did 23000+ steps in my Easy Spirit Romy waking shoes with Dr. Scholls inserts. My feet were in great shape. I love these shoes. I have tendonitis in my left foot,  and these shoes provide support and cushioning. However, there is one caveat, they are leather, and in summer  they are much too warm. For fall through spring they are great.  The price is nice too. Macys often has them on sale.\nAdding my experience with Hokas. I regularly wear a Clifton, 2 pairs mint green and purple! So for Italy last summer I bought Hoka Transport, slimmer design, nicer looking, neutral eggshell color. I was happy to have the Vibram sole since we had a couple of downpours. But the cushioning did not match my Cliftons. We generally walk 5-8 mile days. My feet felt it at the end of the day. I found myself missing the higher level of cushioning. Uncertain on what the take to Spain this year! \nAs a runner of many years, I will add the advice of going to a running store to be properly fitted. Everyone's foot is different and what works for me may not work for you for various reasons. I wear either Asics Gel Kayano (until they recently completely changed them and now they are awful), Muzino Wave Inspire, or On Clouds. I will also add to invest in good socks as well. I really like Feetures and have run numerous long distance races with no blisters. With the right fitting shoes and socks you can walk for miles without tired feet or blisters. \nUpthread, Pam mentions Zappos. I do love their return policy.  I have wide feet so I can have difficulty finding what I need in a store, and its very frustrating to order and go through a return process. Zappos makes it quite easy. Another similar option is DSW. I have one a couple miles from me so what I do fairly often is order a bunch of shoes from DSW online and then I can jump in the car and easily return what doesn't work.\nRegarding Allbirds, I agree they aren't the optimal shoe for walking long distances. However, when I'm going on a trip with the possibility of a fair amount of rain, I'll bring my mizzles for the rainy days. I also like my mizzles when the weather gets chilly where I live. Likewise, I purchased Mizzles for my Seattle son, and he likes them so much for the Seattle weather he has since purchased a couple more pairs.\nFor Jogging I use Altra running shoes. Currently I have a pair of Altra Torun 6. They are zero-drop or completely flat. But I am trying to land on my forefoot instead of my heel when jogging. I got used to the zero-drop immediately. I wouldn't buy any shoe that isn't totally flat or very close to totally flat. For normal walking I still strike first with my heel. Yeah its possible to re-teach yourself how to jog or walk if necessary. Its fine that I am a man because they make women's variations of the shoes I own or very similar models for women. My running shoes are the opposite of water resistant. My current preference for major trips is a water-resistant outdoor shoe. In the last 5 years on major trips I have worn Sketchers \""outdoor\"" shoes or Columbia Fairbanks hiking shoes. They both did the job fine except that the water-resistance of both shoes wore off soon after I first wore them and I had to treat them with water-proofing spray. Just breath out the whole time you are spraying and don't inhale the spray. \nI had never worn Clarks shoes before, but for our Paris and the Heart of France Tour I purchased a pair of Clarks Wellman Low Waterproof shoes and they worked great for our tour and the 10 day trip to Normandy after the tour. The soles were very supportive and stable on the cobblestones and dirt trails even in the rain, and since they were \""casual sneakers\"" and not \""sport shoes\"" they looked both dressy with chinos and casual with shorts and jeans.  \nI also brought a pair of Vessi Weekenders because of the anticipated rainy weather in France at the end of October and they worked well, but were not quite as supportive or stable on uneven ground since their soles were more flexible.  They were very comfortable, though.  My wife loved her Vessi's on that trip as well.\nWe just returned from 27 days in Budapest and Prague including an 8-day Viking River Cruise in-between and were walking 5-7 miles per day on sometimes very uneven cobblestones and they were comfortable and gave great support.  I also wore a pair of Allbirds Wool Runner 2s with their upgraded soles and they were also very comfortable, but I did like the support of the Clarks more on the worst cobblestones.\nMy wife purchased a pair of Allbirds Mizzles and a pair of Allbirds Trail Runners for our Central Europe trip and loved them.  She has pretty bad bunions and Allbirds were the most comfortable shoes she has tried so far.  She had no problems with all of the cobblestones and multiple-mile days and no problems with her bunions!  Her bunions outgrew her Vessi's so she was not able to wear them on this most recent trip.\nHope this helps and have safe travels everyone!\nI am currently on a trip in Spain walking 8-10 miles a day. I have\nbeen wearing Brooks and am not having any issues also it was easy to use the app here. Last year in London\nI was wearing Nikes also walking 8-10 miles and developed plantar fasciitis.\nI have changed my shoes to Brooks as well  and it has greatly improved my comfort on long walks. I'm going to Scotland in two weeks for a two day hike and am now looking for something suitable, wondering whether to keep just these or bring another pair with me for a change.\nhttps://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/best-travel-shoes\nThere has been so much written about this topic- perhaps you'll find some helpful info in the Forum Search above. Safe travels!\nTeachers, nurses, hikers, favorite shoes:  HOKA’s.\nI’am a former Marathon runner and honestly wear my HOKA’s every day of the year.

She has personally tested nearly 300 bags, jeans, bras, shoes, and more.\nNo-show socks are the unsung—and unseen—heroes of many a stylish ensemble.\nNeatly tucked inside a sneaker or slip-on, they leave ankles breezily exposed while protecting feet from the stinky, blister-inducing indignities of going sockless.\nBut finding the right pair isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Subpar versions have a maddening tendency to creep down, bunch up, pinch, squeeze, and make your feet sweat.\nWe pounded the pavement in dozens of no-show socks, ultimately landing on five comfortable, incognito picks that suit a variety of tastes, budgets, occasions, and shoe types.\nAdvertisement\nThese casual, well-cushioned, cotton-blend socks don’t slip down or make feet overheat. They’re spendy, but they’re comfortable enough to justify the splurge.\nThese casual, well-cushioned cotton-blend socks don’t slip down or make feet overheat. They’re spendy, but they’re comfortable enough to justify the splurge.\nThe Bombas Cushioned No Show Socks, available in women’s and men’s sizes, are true crowd-pleasers. Their soft, cushioned material and secure fit keep feet comfy and cool all day.\nAdmittedly, the price per pair is on the steep side, but the mileage we logged in them convinced us that they’re worth it.\nThey work best with sneakers and athletic shoes. The Bombas no-show socks are pretty invisible under most sneakers, although their 360-degree silhouette doesn’t totally disappear under a lower-profile tennis shoe.\nThe heel of the Bombas no-show socks comes up 0.25 to 0.5 inch higher than on our picks from Stance and Idegg, so they peek out of the back of some shoes. But this also makes them more pleasant to wear—they protect more of your ankle from rubbing against the shoe.\nThese are the thickest socks we recommend—we like wearing them with roomier shoes. Snugger footwear may feel too tight with these socks, or get stretched out by them.\nThey’re plush and breathable. Testers raved about the Bombas no-show socks’ “thick, soft” material. They’re made with high-quality Supima cotton, an extra-long staple varietal known for its durability and softness.\nAlthough this material feels substantial, it wasn’t overly hot: The breathable blend of cotton, polyester, nylon, and elastane kept our feet cool and dry.\nWe particularly appreciated their springy, well-cushioned footbeds—the most padded of any we tested—which offered all-day support.\nThey fit lots of feet. The Bombas socks are available in the widest size range of any socks we tested —from women’s 4 to men’s 16. “These socks fit like Cinderella’s slippers,” said one tester (women’s size 5, Bombas women’s small). “Most no-show socks bunch at the heel, but with these, there’s no extra fabric leaking out the sides of my shoes.”\nMy own foot (women’s size 8, Bombas women’s medium) was comfortably ensconced, with no pinching or bunching at the heel or toe. And our tester who wears a women’s size 11 said that the Bombas women’s large “felt like a cozy hug from a non-creepy relative.”\nThey stay put. Three grippy silicone strips line the inside of each sock’s heel, keeping them firmly in place as you move around or remove your shoes. When we tried to rub the socks off with our thumbs during testing, they eventually slipped down, but it took some force.\nThe fabric also does its part: The stretchy, resilient blend keeps the socks snug and secure on your feet and helps them retain their shape through repeated washes and wears.\nThey’re pricey but worth it. Some people (myself included) may balk at the idea of spending more than $10 on a pair of tiny cotton socks. But the Bombas no-show socks’ soft Supima cotton, secure fit, and cloud-like cushioning made a convert of me. Plus, for every pair purchased, Bombas donates a pair to a person in need.\nBombas socks are backed by a lifetime happiness guarantee. If anything happens to them—from regular wear-and-tear to getting eaten by your dryer (really)—the company will send you a replacement.\nMaterial: 86% Supima cotton, 11% polyester, 2% elastane, 1% nylonSizes: women’s 4 to men’s 16Colors: 12\nThese thin cotton-blend socks are great for wearing with snugger shoes, and they don’t slip or bunch. They’re not as soft and smooth as our other picks, but they get the job done, and they’re priced to stock up.\nIdegg No Show Socks (in unisex and men’s sizes) are a completely serviceable no show sock—and we mean that as a compliment. They check the most important boxes: They don’t slip down, they stay hidden under most sneakers and many dress shoes, and they’re comfortable. Plus, they do it all at a bargain price.\nTheir thin material doesn’t offer padding or support, but it’s lightweight, breathable, and doesn’t add bulk, making these socks an easy, versatile choice.\nThey work best with sneakers and dressier shoes, like oxfords. The Idegg socks have a similar profile to another pick, the Bombas Cushioned No Show Socks, but they hit 0.25 inch lower on the sides of the foot and back of the heel, making this cut a bit more versatile.\nThe Ideggs No Show Socks are incognito under most low-top sneakers or men’s dress shoe silhouettes, but they peek out under deeper-cut shoes like loafers.\nTheir thin material is well-suited for snugger shoes. But their lack of cushioning means they’re not great for long, active days.\nThey get the job done. Made from a lightweight blend of cotton, polyester, and spandex, the Idegg socks are perhaps most noteworthy for how few complaints they elicited. “They’re pretty unremarkable, and I mean that in the best possible way,” said one tester. “They didn’t create any lumps or bumps inside my sneakers, and my feet didn’t sweat.”\nThey felt just right in tighter-fitting shoes; in our cushier picks from Bombas and Celersport, those same shoes felt overstuffed. (The Idegg socks weren’t as delightfully weightless as our even-thinner pick from Stance, but that pair costs five times as much.)\nThe Idegg socks have the highest polyester content (17%) of our picks, so they’re not as soft and smooth as the others. But once they were on our feet, we barely noticed the difference.\nThey fit well and don’t budge. Our testers gave the Idegg socks a perfect five out of five score for fit. “There was no excess fabric on the sides, so they didn’t ooze out of my shoes,” noted one (women’s size 5, Idegg unisex size small).\nAn extra-stretchy band wraps around the socks’ arches, helping them to fit snugly and stay put. Like our Bombas and Stance picks, the Idegg socks have three silicone strips inside the heel to keep them from slipping down. They didn’t budge, even when we rubbed our thumbs up and down against the back of our heels.\nYou don’t have to be precious with them. Idegg socks are the least expensive of our picks, they’re widely available in a broad range of sizes, and they come in packs of six. So it’s no biggie if a sock or two disappears in the wash.\nMaterial: 80% cotton, 17% polyester, 3% spandexSizes: women’s 5 to men’s 14Colors: over a dozen\nAdvertisement\nThe airiest, smoothest pair we put on our feet, these cotton-blend socks are simultaneously thin and supportive—a rarity—and unusually sweat-wicking. They’re also available in the most vibrant range of colors and patterns—but they aren’t cheap.\nStance Icon No Show Socks are a treat for your feet. They’re even lighter than our basic Idegg pick and much softer and smoother. (They’re also nearly five times the price.)\nThe Stance socks are made from a combed-cotton blend that feels airy and sleek beneath snug shoes but still provides support via light compression and subtle cushioning. Plus, they’re totally seamless, so nothing bunches up in your shoes or presses against your feet.\nThey’re best worn with low-top sneakers, or dressier shoes like oxfords. The Stance no-show socks have the lowest heel of any sock we tested, which makes them great at disappearing behind the backs of shoes. But they’re not ideal for wearing with shoes that rub against your ankles, since they leave lots of that sensitive skin exposed.\nAlthough the Stance socks are low on the backs and sides, they come up fairly high on the bridge of the foot; they peek out of most low-cut loafers and slip-ons. (For those types of shoes, we recommend our Eedor pick, but it only comes in women’s sizes 5-12.)\nThey’re so comfy, we forgot we were wearing them. The Stance no-show socks don’t merely disappear into your shoes—they feel invisible, too. “The fabric melted into my feet like butter,” said one tester.\nThey’re made from a light and smooth blend of combed cotton—for extra softness and durability—plus nylon and 4% elastane, which adds some nice stretchiness that helps the socks conform instantly to the foot. (The exact fabric composition may vary a bit, depending on the colorway; there were no noticeable differences in texture, stretch, or breathability between any of the pairs that we tested.)\nSome barely there (yet deeply appreciated) cushioning is on the front third of the sock bed, plus a lightly compressive band that hugs the arch of your foot. “These socks felt supportive, without any pinching or squeezing,” said a tester.\nThese are a great choice if your feet tend to get swampy—they have the highest nylon content (39% in the colorway pictured) of any of our picks, so they’re better at wicking away moisture.\nThey’re cut low, but they stay up. Despite their extra-low profile across the heel and sides, the Stance no-shows felt secure. Three silicone strips kept them firmly gripped to our ankles while wearing shoes and when taking them off. (Their stretchy fabric and the arch compression band also help the socks stay in place.)\nStill, the Stance socks aren’t quite as slip-resistant as our picks from Bombas and Idegg, which have similar silicone grips, since those socks come up higher on the heel. When we rubbed the back of the Stance socks vigorously with our thumbs, they did peel down a bit, though we never had an issue while actually wearing them.\nWe recommend air-drying this pair. They have a higher percentage of synthetic fabric than our other picks, so they’re more sensitive to high heat from the dryer. In our tests, the Stance socks that we air-dried retained more elasticity, whereas the ones that we tumble dried got a bit stretched-out and didn’t stay up as well.\nThey’re available in lots of sizes, colors, and patterns. The Stance socks come in a broad range of sizes (almost as many as the Bombas Cushioned No Show Socks) and—if secretly fun socks are your thing—colors and patterns beyond the usual, including two skin-tone hues, some vibrant solids and stripes, and a few statement-making graphic prints.\nMaterial: 57% combed cotton, 39% nylon, 4% elastane; fabric composition may vary slightly by colorwaySizes: women’s 5 to men’s 13Colors: over a dozen colors and patterns\nThin and stretchy, these are the only socks we tested that were low enough to hide beneath a deep-cut loafer and didn’t squeeze, pinch, slip, or make our feet sweat. But they’re only available in women’s sizes 5 through 12.\nUltra-low no-show socks—the type you can wear with loafers and other slip-ons—have a tough needle to thread. They must not reveal themselves while somehow managing to stay securely in place. And as these slivers of fabric grip on for dear life, they shouldn’t be so tight that they squeeze your feet or leave indentations.\nThe Eedor Women’s Non Slip Low Cut Socks were the only pair we tested that met these criteria. Note that they’re only available in women’s sizes from 5 to 12 (the equivalent of men’s sizes up to 10½).\nThey’re best worn with loafers, boat shoes, or slip-ons. Unique among our picks, the Eedor socks are cut low enough to be nearly imperceptible beneath footwear with deep vee cuts. But these socks aren’t low enough to vanish beneath, say, a ballet flat.\nThough the Eedor socks hit much lower on the top of the foot than our lightweight pick from Stance, they do come up 0.25 inch higher on the heel, so they may peek out a bit from the backs of some shoes.\nSince they’re made from a thin, stretchy cotton-spandex blend that doesn’t add bulk, they’re well suited for snug, dressier shoes.\nThey’re much comfier than other ultra-low socks we tried. The Eedor socks weren’t as comfortable as our other picks, but they were the most pleasant to wear of any ultra-low-profile socks we tried—by far. Their light, 80% cotton material is much more breathable than the sweat-inducing nylon hosiery often used in these liner-style socks.\nThe Eedor socks fit more tightly than the other socks we recommend, which is necessary for them to stay put—but they didn’t squeeze. Said one tester, “Some other really low-cut pairs I’ve tried were so tight that they gave my foot a muffin top. But these have more forgiving stretch, so they don’t feel like Spanx for the feet.” And, unlike other low-cuts, the Eedor socks didn’t leave behind angry indentations.\nThey’re surprisingly secure. This style of sock is inherently more prone to slipping down. But the Eedor socks were among the most secure that we tested. They withstood being rubbed vigorously as we tried to peel them down even better than our picks from Bombas and Stance, and just as well as our Idegg pick.\nThe Eedor socks owe their staying power to a grippy crescent-shape strip of silicone at the heels. Plus, their 20% spandex content makes them extra stretchy, so they conform snugly to feet.\nThey’re inexpensive. Teeny tiny socks are my dryer’s favorite snack, so I appreciate that the Eedor socks are priced reasonably and sold in sets of three, four, and six.\nMaterial: 80% cotton, 20% spandexSizes: women’s 5 to 12Colors: 10\nAdvertisement\nSoft, springy, and comfortable, these ankle socks vanish beneath high tops and ankle boots while protecting skin from chafing. But they’re not the best material for running or other sweaty workouts.\nLess isn’t always more when it comes to no-show socks. For higher-cut footwear like ankle boots and high-tops, you don’t want your socks on display—but you don’t want delicate skin rubbing against your shoes, either. Enter the Celersport Ankle Athletic Running Socks: They were an instant favorite with testers due to their perfect fit, breathability, and absence of slippage or bunching.\nDespite their name, the Celersport running socks are better suited to everyday wear than running or heavy-duty workouts; their combed cotton is sweat-absorbing rather than sweat-wicking, which could lead to blisters.\nThey’re best worn with ankle boots and high-tops. The Celersport socks successfully vanish beneath ankle-height footwear, while cushiony back tabs keep those stiffer shoes from rubbing against skin.\nIn low-top sneakers, they stayed mostly hidden behind the tongues of our shoes, but they peeked over the sides and backs. If you don’t mind a hint of sock showing, they’ll give you a sporty look.\nThough they’re not quite as thick as our cushiony Bombas pick, the Celersport socks are well padded, so they work best in roomier shoes. The cushioning on the footbed, and especially on the ankle tab, make them too bulky to wear with snug kicks.\nThey’re the comfiest socks we tested. Of the 32 socks we tried, the Celersport socks were, hands down, the most comfortable, earning a perfect five out of five rating from testers. (They even beat out our comfy and far pricier pick from Bombas.)\nThe Celersport socks are soft, made from a blend of 88.3% combed cotton plus polyester and spandex. They’re breathable, thanks to their high cotton content and mesh-knit tops. And they’re extra cushiony, with plenty of padding at the toe and heel. They also scored a perfect five out of five from all our testers for fit—one panelist called them “delightful,” adding, “they hugged my foot just right, and I didn’t notice any excess sweatiness.”\nThey’re slouch-proof. Their ankle height makes it easy for them to stay put, without the aid of silicone strips. No one who tried these socks experienced any slippage—and one tester even wore them on two 5-mile outings.\nThey’re inexpensive and available in lots of sizes. Like our picks from Idegg and Eedor, the Celersport socks are reasonably priced and a terrific option if you like to stock up. They come in packs of six and are available in a wide range of sizes, so replacing lost or worn-out pairs is no biggie.\nMaterial: 88.3% combed cotton, 10.7% polyester, 1% spandexSizes: women’s 5 to men’s 15.5Colors: three\nThe no-show socks we recommend can be worn with casual shoes like sneakers, and some of them can be worn with dressier shoes and lower-cut shoes like loafers. We decided to forgo skimpy, toe-cleavage-exposing no-show socks, because—in our opinion—they’re simply too unpleasant to wear and don’t offer enough utility.\nTo select socks for testing, I considered recommendations from publications including Good Housekeeping, GQ, Glamour, and The New York Times. I perused Amazon’s best sellers and other popular sites, read countless reviews, and asked friends and coworkers for suggestions.\nBased on that research, I selected 26 socks to personally test, plus six additional styles—which weren’t available in my size (a women’s 8)—for my partner (a men’s 11) to test. We wore them, washed them, dried them, and repeated.\nOur collective 10 favorites underwent further testing with two Wirecutter colleagues (a women’s size 11 and a women’s size 5). Testers wore the socks with and without shoes and provided detailed feedback.\nWe looked for the following:\nAdvertisement\nA lightweight—yet padded—pair to wear with snugger shoes: The Comrad Combed Cotton No Show Socks, in unisex sizes from S to XL (women’s 4 to men’s 15), are similar to our Idegg pick but softer and more cushiony. They don’t show under most oxfords or sneakers, and grippy silicone dots at the heel keep them from slipping down. But they had fit issues: On a women’s size 8 tester, the medium was a little too roomy, while a women’s size 11 tester found the size large excessively compressive and tight.\nA well-cushioned sock similar to our Bombas pick, but cheaper: The Mack Weldon Everyday No Show Socks, available in men’s sizes only (7 to 13), are just as plush as the Bombas Cushioned No Show Socks, for a slightly lower price. They’re made from a comfy combed cotton blend, with ample padding from heel to toe, and are cut just right for sneakers. But the substantial heel grips in the back—which keep them from slipping down—add more bulk than the slimmer silicone strips on the Bombas socks and may cause fit issues with some shoes.\nThe Bombas Lightweight No Show Socks, Leotruny Unisex No Show Socks, Saucony Women’s Invisible Liner Socks, and Wander Men’s No Show Socks all fit poorly at the heel. The Stance Performance Tab Socks had excess fabric at the toes.\nThe Fruit of the Loom Men’s Dual Defense Cushioned Socks, Adidas Men’s Superlite No Show Socks and Under Armour Performance Tech No Show Socks all slipped down our heels and showed over sneakers.\nThe ankle-cut Hanes Women’s No Show Socks and Saucony Men’s Comfort Fit No-Show Socks were fine, but not as comfy as our Celersport pick.\nThe Lululemon Women’s Power Stride No-Show Sock with Active Grip 3 Pack had bunchy, overly structured heel cups.\nThe Ondo Organic Cotton No Show Socks bunched at the heel and toe. We also had heel-to-toe issues with three of the worst-fitting pairs we tried, the Quince Everyday Lightweight Cotton No-Show Socks, the Vans Classic Super No Show Socks, and the Amazon Essentials Women’s Cotton Lightly Cushioned No-Show Socks.\nMost ultra-low-cut styles were overly tight and sweat-inducing, like the Peds Women’s Low Cut No Show Socks. The Wernies No Show Socks felt like shapewear, and when we took off the Jormatt Men’s No Show Socks, it looked like our feet had been garroted.\nThe Skims Everyday Ankle Sock pair was very soft, but they’re only available in women’s sizes 6 to 10, and they pilled in the wash. The Falke Cool Kick Unisex No Show Socks also pilled, and they slipped down our heels after laundering.\nThis article was edited by Ingela Ratledge Amundson and Jennifer Hunter.\nAdvertisement\nZoe Vanderweide\nZoe Vanderweide is a senior staff writer reporting on style and accessories at Wirecutter.

I like they have that super low option (which I need for one pair of heels for sure). Bombas website has a LOT of options! (a bit overwhelming), but also thousands of 5 star reviews on so many products. And I liked that when someone did leave a 2 or 3 star, the customer service replied very kindly & thoroughly, and offered a link every time to help resolve it; so customer service seems better than I am used to, which makes me feel better about the price (they're expensive...). Oh, also! As a new customer I easily got a 20% off code that was automatically applied, so that was great too!\n  \n\nTomorrow I will buy two or three more brands (idk which, I have too go back to all of your comments, plus look online) and/or I will also go to Costco (as the Cole Haan ones a few people recommended sound great). I've decided to order a few brands because with all of your suggestions, I now want to do a comparison. Thanks so so much everybody! I will do an update two when I decide on the other two or three brands I'll order/buy. And another update when they arrive and get tested out ❤️\n  \n\n    ⬇️ 🧦 ⬇️ 🧦  ⬇️ 🧦 ⬇️ 🧦\n  \n\n    **Update 2: I stumbled up Vans no-show socks variety 3 sock pack at DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse so bought some. Been wearing them several hours around the house with one of new pair of tennis shoes, and wow! These Vans socks are so comfortable! And are staying on well so far (although I've just been puttering around the house not walking a ton). The colors are crazy one rainbow checkerboard with white, I e rainbow checkerboard with black, and a gray with a bit of rainbow checkerboard -- but because no-show, it doesn't matter (and bonus: it will be easy to find the matching sock). These are fantastic, but I will say they are for tennis shoes and I think for sure would show with flats/heels. It is a while until the Bombas order arrives, so just wanted to give the heads up that Vans no-shows to me seem of quite good quality and are great with tennis shoes.\n\n\n    🤪 🧦 ❤️ 🧦 🤦‍♀️ ⬇️ 🤪  🧦 ❤️  🧦 Update 3: (and I edited update 2 to reflect new info)\n  \n\nVANS SOCKS GOT A HOLE AFTER ONE WASHING! 😥\n  \n\n    **Bombas Low Cut No-Show are 🎉🧦 amazing!

Learn about our methodology here, and find all our Best in Class guides here.\n          \nMy shampoo shelf tells the story of my many failed hairstyles. There’s the purple shampoo from my DIY-bleach escapades — and the bond builder that recovered the damage. There’s the hydrating shampoo for when I’ve gone too heavy with the heat, and the color-safe shampoo I use to preserve my ruby-red look. After so many experiments, I know how to nurse my hair back from brittle and split to shiny and plump. And while I’ve written stories about the best shampoos for those different hair types — from fine to color-treated — here, I’ve thought about the best shampoos for any type of hair.\nWhile testing out these shampoos, I learned that what makes a shampoo great is going to depend on your hair type. So I’ve focused on some subcategories throughout, while also considering whether my picks will predominantly work for all hair types. In my testing, I kept these factors in mind: People usually shampoo more than they condition (I double-shampoo, once to get rid of any buildup and once to truly cleanse the hair), so if you’re someone who notices your hair drying easily, looking for hydrating ingredients like glycerin, oils, and butters is wise. Those who notice oil gathering at their roots might want to look for clarifying shampoos instead — they contain sulfates which deeply clean the hair of any impurities. Those with color-damaged hair will by now know that once salon-exclusive brands like Olaplex are now readily available online — but that doesn’t change the fact they’re still pricey, so I tested whether or not it’s worthwhile to spring for the brands that your stylist reaches for.\nBeyond that, I tested all the fun stuff (the scent it will leave lingering) and the practical stuff, too (the value you’re getting). I’ve used several of these shampoos for weeks or months at a time, but the parameters I looked for were always the same: How clean does my hair feel, how healthy does my hair feel, and does it have that shine and bounce that I crave?\nUpdate on September 12, 2024: Updated prices and checked stock for all products.\nSulfates are a divisive product, but the tl;dr is they’re okay as far as the experts are concerned, though those with easily irritated skin or extremely brittle hair may want to steer clear. So if you’re someone with really dry hair or skin, you’ll be better suited to a sulfate-free option. (And in all honesty, you likely don’t need them: Sulfates are basically like really strong detergents and are better for oiler hair types who need that really deep clean.) One thing to note, though, is sulfates are what usually gives a shampoo that satisfying lather — so many sulfate-free options won’t foam up as much as you’re probably used to. For more in-depth information, read my deep dive into sulfates.\nThe way my shampoo smells is super-important to me — I don’t want a cloud of fragrance I hate following me around all day. I’ve noted below the types of scents each shampoo has — if you’re torn between two formulas that will both suit your hair, this just might be what swings it.\nAs someone who always has a few bottles in rotation, I know shampoo can get expensive. Below, I’ve noted how many ounces of you get for the cost of the shampoo so you can get a sense of value for your dollar.\nSulfate free | Scent: Fresh | Size: 8 oz. \nI started using this shampoo a year ago on the recommendation of several hair-care experts — and despite the many testers on my shelf, I’ve kept reaching for it ever since. Firstly, it’s formulated with plenty of hydrating, nourishing ingredients. I no longer have bleach damage, but I do still use heat, and have noticed in the past that the ends of my hair will feel dry within minutes of me stepping out of the shower. I no longer notice that with this shampoo. It has intensely hydrating ingredients — like glycerin — and is sulfate free, so it won’t overly strip dryer or chemically treated hair. And despite the lack of sulfates, the shampoo does have a nice lather to it, which always makes me feel like it’s doing its job.\nIn the place of sulfates are organic amino acids derived from coconut, which still give that thorough cleanse. That’s why it’s suitable for both oily and dry hair types: It’s cleansing, but not stripping. “I like the Malin + Goetz shampoo because it’s not 100 percent organic, and it’s also not 100 percent chemical,” says Masami Hosono, founder and creative director of Vacancy Project. “It has both, and you really need both, especially if you have a color or anything chemical in your hair. It’s really for any hair type, and it’s not too heavy.”\nThe shampoo is also vegan and cruelty-free — meaning it’s truly suitable for anyone. That, along with the fresh botanical scent it leaves, its mid-price point on this list, and the fact it cleanses my roots and consistently delivers moisture to my once brittle ends is why I’m calling it our best shampoo overall. It’s worth saying that while I liked the Malin + Goetz conditioner, I didn’t call it our best in class. That’s fine! You don’t need to look for the same formulas within your shampoo and conditioner, and, in fact, mixing and matching them can help you unlock a routine that’s tailored to your hair.\nSulfate free | Scent: Floral | Size: 12 oz\nFor less than a third of the price of Malin and Goetz, you can get this sulfate-free shampoo from Monday. It’s a New Zealand hair-care line that offers simply outstanding value for money. Myself and fellow Strategist writers love its volumizing shampoo, but the brand also has smoothing and moisturizing options at the same price point. Instead of sulfates, its volumizing shampoo has moisturizing ingredients like shea butter and coconut oil, as well as rice protein, which adds some plumpness to thinner hair. I’ve been using its volumizing shampoo for a couple months now, and I’ve noticed the volume in my roots when I blow-dry my hair. I also like the floral scent, which merges nicely with the botanical scent of my Malin + Goetz (as I mentioned before, I’m a double-shampooer). As someone with dyed hair who likes to wash less frequently, I like the fact I don’t have to be precious with this shampoo when I do wash. Hairstylist Jenna Perry, the founder of Jenna Perry Hair Studio (which caters to clients including Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, and Chloë Sevigny), agrees. She says it’s a “great-smelling” shampoo that “doesn’t break the bank.”\nNon–sulfate free | Scent: Fruity floral | Size: 8.4 oz. \nWhat is in-between hair, you ask? Hair that’s not too oily and not too dry. That means you don’t need intensely hydrating ingredients, nor do you need a bunch of clarifying ones. While our best overall is suited to most hair types, perhaps you find moisturizing ingredients weigh your hair down, or sulfate-free formulas aren’t cleansing enough. That’s why Sachajuan’s shampoo is great: It treads that line perfectly. Although Sachajuan uses sulfates, stylist Brooke Jordan tells me all those ingredients are produced in “small batches in Sweden” and that “in Europe, they have so many more regulations for their beauty products than we do, so essentially anything that’s made in Europe is sort of automatically going to be a little safer than what’s produced here.” I’m someone whose hair falls on the drier side of normal, but when I first started using this shampoo, I didn’t find it particularly stripping — in fact, I quite liked how thoroughly clean my hair felt (and for a few weeks, I gave up my double-shampooing habit). When I switched to sampling a different shampoo, though, I noticed instantly that my hair felt a little less dry at the ends on days two and three after washing. So here’s my verdict: It won’t strip your hair dramatically, but if your hair is really dry and color-damaged like mine, I’d skip this shampoo and opt for something a touch more hydrating.\nNon–sulfate free | Scent: Jasmine, bergamot, and sandalwood | Size: 9.8 oz.\nI don’t have curly hair, but I do know how to spot curly-hair-appropriate shampoo. Curlier hair types can trap oil at the root, meaning that lengths and ends can feel drier and more brittle — so hydrating ingredients are advised. This shampoo from Tracee Ellis Ross’s hair-care line has precisely those, with honey, aloe vera, biotin (which is a vitamin), and ten oils including coconut and avocado oil. Although it has sulfates to deeply cleanse, you’re getting plenty of moisture back into your hair, which makes it easy to untangle and style after washing. “It’s really incredible,” says Stephanie Louis, the chief executive and operating officer of Stylebox Salon. She also tells me that it’s a hydrating shampoo suitable for all curly hair types — including very curly hair with 3B-4C curls.\nSulfate free | Scent: Grapefruit and oatmeal | Size: 12 oz.\nVerb is one of my favorite hair-care brands — it makes my favorite conditioner of all time — and this shampoo was a contender for best overall. While stylists have told me it works for many hair types, I think it’s best suited to fine, frizzy hair (for me, Malin + Goetz has the edge when it comes to universal appeal). It’s a clean shampoo, meaning it’s paraben-, sulfate-, and cruelty-free. It also still has a lather, despite its lack of sulfates, which is a huge pro for me. Ingredients like moringa oil and sunflower-seed extract are included to help smooth out hair from root to tip — and banish frizz. “No matter the hair texture or type, it detangles with ease, moisturizes immediately, and doesn’t leave hair feeling heavy with product,” Louis tells me. “It’s really amazing, top-shelf stuff,” Louis tells me (it’s her favorite shampoo to use with clients). With a pleasant grapefruit scent, and a rather good 12 ounces for just $20, this shampoo gets a huge thumbs-up from me.\nSulfate free | Scent: Sweet and fruity | Size: 8.5 oz\nI usually get my hair cut every two months, but sometimes I really push it; I left it over four months between my last two appointments. Usually, by that stage, my ends would be close to snapping off and my flyaways would be unmanageable, but this shampoo from Bumble and Bumble has really helped me keep on top of things. I introduced it to my rotation (alongside the less-expensive Monday shampoo for a double-cleanse) after my hair felt a little stripped. It earns its name: It doesn’t feel greasy as you’re applying it, and it doesn’t feel like an oil — it actually has a very generous lather for a sulfate-free shampoo — but I can feel it smoothing my hair even as I apply it in the shower. The combination of coconut, argan, and macadamia-seed oil have all added some life back into my (desperately) splitting ends. Once I get my trim, I’ll be keeping this in my shower for when I want a hydrating, smoothing shampoo that’ll help me achieve a sleek blow-dry.\nNon-sulfate free | Scent: Floral musky | Size: 8.5 oz\nSome hair types are just prone to thinning, and some hair thins as a reaction to stress or as a natural part of aging. No matter why your hair is thinning, shampoos packed with plumping, moisturizing ingredients can not only make the hair appear thicker, but strengthen it and encourage it to grow. Kérastase’s is a particular favorite of beauty writer Linda Dyett’s. It “contains the same hyaluronic acid that hydrates and plumps the skin. It has a similar effect on my hair,” she says. “It’s also got a complex called Intracylane that, intriguingly, was inspired by a chemical process used in glassmaking. It appears to fill in surface gaps on and thicken individual strands of hair.” Intracyclane is a molecule that enters and strengthens strands of hair, from root to tip. The shampoo also has moisturizing ceramides, and stemoxydine, which is a topical used to promote hair growth. It appears gel-like at first but has a satisfying lather and leaves lighter floral notes with a slight musk lingering in your hair.\nSulfate free | Scent: Fruity, woodsy | Size: 8.5 oz. \nIf it’s more the limpness of finer hair you want to address, a volumizing shampoo will help you work some oomph into your roots. I was curious about the Davines Volu shampoo after our resident beauty columnist Rio Viera-Newton (who also has fine hair) recommended it. It works by using turnip extract, which gently lifts the hair from the scalp to give volume at the roots, says Jordan. I’ve been using the Davines in my routine for about six months now, and my flat hair has responded well. There’s not only more lift at my scalp, but more body throughout all my hair after I’ve given it a bouncy blow-dry. I also like the fact that the shampoo is sulfate free, and has moisturizing ingredients — great for fine hair, which usually needs to be washed on the regular side to keep oil at bay, but is also thinner and more prone to breakage. (For even more lift, Jordan recommends using the Volu shampoo with Davines Volu hair mist.)\nSulfate free | Scent: Citrus | Size: 8.5 oz.\nOlaplex and I are old friends — if you’ve really done some damage to your hair, there’s nothing that’s going to soothe it better. For me, that damage was repeated DIY-bleach jobs back in 2021. After a couple of months of Olaplex shampoo, my hair emulated something hairlike, and after a year of consistent use, it was in the best shape it had ever been. Olaplex is what’s called a bond builder. They don’t just clean your hair, they repair the damaged bonds that make up its structure with keratin. Damaged bonds are what cause snaps and split ends, and you can get them from bleaching, pollution, or heat damage. “Bond builders contain specific active ingredients, like amino acids and protein, which are responsible for reconnecting and strengthening the disulfide bonds within the hair’s protein structure,” explains Min Kim, a color specialist.\nIt’s worth saying that there is a salon-only formulation and a retail formulation. This version of the shampoo contains a lower solution of Olaplex you can get from a stylist. That said, it does as any good bond builder should; it “repairs protein bonds in hair, limits split ends and subsequent hair breakage, and helps keep hair smooth and frizz free,” says Louis. There are plenty of dupes on the market, and other brands have entered the bond-builder space (K-18 being the most popular), but Olaplex is still the leading option, as experts agree it works so well. I also recently named it the best shampoo for color-treated hair overall in our in-depth guide and give it singular credit for nursing my hair back from the brink of snapping clean off.\nNon-sulfate free | Scent: Floral | Size: 16 oz.\nBlonde hair can grow brassy over time — even natural blonde hair, which can dull and become discolored from too much heat or harder water. That’s where blonde-specific shampoo comes in. It’s been several years since I was blonde myself, so I deferred to Mary Ann Hennings, hair-department head on Daisy Jones & the Six, for her recommendation. She likes Clairol’s drugstore classic — Shimmer Lights. Hennings finds that the shampoo brightens hair with just a couple of uses. As well as brass-neutralizing purple tones, the shampoo also contains vegetable protein to nourish the hair, and contains sulfates, which thoroughly cleanse the roots of oil. Strategist writer Liza Corsillo agrees — she tried it on her golden-blonde hair. The one downside: Shimmer Lights has a strong “old lady”–like smell, according to Strategist contributor Hesper Desloovere Dixon. “But it knocks the yellow right out of your blonde,” she says. “A once-a-week routine is enough to keep cooler blonde tones fresh and bright.” For the price point, it’s hard to beat.\nSulfate-free | Scent: Unscented | Size: 12 oz.\nThose with sensitive scalps will want to steer clear of any potentially irritating ingredients, such as dyes, parabens, masking fragrances, and sulfates. Strategist writer Erin Schwartz has to avoid those ingredients; after realizing they were allergic to them, they switched to Vanicream. “The first time I used this shampoo, I was incredulous that I didn’t feel any stinging or itchiness, which I had thought was a normal aftereffect of cleaning your hair,” says Schwartz. Crucially, Schwartz says that as well as being scalp-friendly, the shampoo does its job of keeping the hair clean. “My hair routine has gotten easier and cheaper, and reliably produces boy-band-floppy-hair days,” they say. Instead of parabens, the shampoo uses a mild surfactant (the ingredient that separates the dirt from the hair), which is derived from coconut. It cleanses, has no harsh smell, and keeps oily roots and dandruff under control.\n• Haley Campise, stylist at Keith Kristofer• Rogerio Cavalcante, stylist and owner of the Second Floor Salon• Maria Elizabeth, hairstylist and founder of Salon deZEN• Jessica Prince Erlich, beauty writer and editor• Shirley Hagel, retired advanced creative stylist at Parlor salon• Mary Ann Hennings, hair department head on Daisy Jones and the Six• Masami Hosono, founder and creative director of Vacancy Project• Brooke Jordan, co-founder and master stylist at the Bird House• Stephanie Louis, chief executive and operating officer of Stylebox Salon• Dhiran Mistry, hairstylist• Patti O’Gara, colorist at Blackstone NYC• Gregory Patterson, celebrity hairstylist• Dominique Pariso, Strategist writer• Chelsey Pickthorn, master stylist at Pickthorn studio• Clariss Rubenstein, hairstylist• Marco Santini, hairstylist• Erin Schwartz, Strategist writer\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.

Before joining TechRadar, I spent three years at What Hi-Fi? testing everything the world of audio had to offer; before that, I was a professional dancer. My love of music ties it all together.\nSeptember 9, 2024\nUpdated our intro to reflect new features and perks within the newest headphones around. Updated our 'Also consider' section to mention recent models tested.\nWhy you can trust TechRadar \n\n\nWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best headphones in our list. We've tested each one extensively, so these recommendations are based on real-world experience.\nOur expert review:\n✅ You want versatile headphones that sound good: The Sony WH-1000XM4s deliver high-quality sound in a lightweight folding design that's good for travel.\n\n✅ You want strong noise cancellation: With the volume  up and the noise cancelling on, the WH-1000XM4 can block out a lot.\n❌ You plan on bringing them to the gym or beach: A looser fit and lack of water-resistance should make you think twice before putting them inside your gym bag.\n\n❌ You take tons of conference calls: While these are great for travel, their call quality isn't that strong. \nDespite the fact that the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones have now been released, we still rate the WH-1000XM4 as the best pick for most people because they're now usually such good value. A combination of a permanent price drop plus regular heavy discounts during sales events means that they can usually be found for a price lower than other premium headphones, while still delivering excellent all-round performance – look for a price under $200 / £200 and you'll be happy.\nThey sound is weighty by well-balanced, with a warm and inviting tone. They're generous with the bass, but not overly so. The active noise cancellation is very strong too, and though it's been bettered by the Sony XM5 and Bose's latest headphones, it's great for the price if you buy at a discount.\nThey're bursting with features too, including Sony's DSEE Extreme upscaling for lower-quality music from sources such as Spotify, multipoint pairing for easy switching between devices, auto play/pause when you take them off, Sony's 360 Reality Audio spatial audio, and LDAC wireless support for CD-quality wire-free sound from compatible phones. It's a shame there's no aptX, but it's not a deal-breaker.\nThey're very comfortable thanks to a lightweight design, and wearing them for long periods is no strain at all. A 3.5mm jack means you can connect them to a wired source easily, though there's no USB-C audio input (the USB-C port is for charging only).\nThe 30-hour battery life is pretty typical, though is smashed by the 60 hours of the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 at #3 on the list, which also clearly beat these on sound quality when comparing the two, though as mentioned above, we still think the Sony are great value at their reduced price. That's the story for these headphones at this point: you can find something that does any individual thing better, but nothing that does so much so well as their lower price. But make sure you're paying $200/£200 or under. If Sony bumps the price back up a bit, you're best opting for the Cambridge Audio option – they'll cost the same and bring you even more modern, high-end features.\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM4 review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You want well-balanced sound: Don't like how bass-heavy or shiny in the treble cheap headphones can be? No danger of that here – they're perfectly tuned.\n\n✅ You love a long battery life: With 50 hours of battery, these will basically always have juice when you need them.\n❌ You want active noise cancellation: There's no ANC here, and the passive noise isolation isn't really notable either. Consider the 1More Sonoflow if you need this for cheap.\n\n❌ You're hoping for really audiophile sound: The balance and sound profile is great here, but a cheap pair of wired headphones will sound notably better.\nWith solid audio, great battery life and Bluetooth connectivity, the Sony WH-CH520 are excellent bang for your buck. If you’re looking for on-ear headphones at this price point, you’re likely already willing to make a few sacrifices. Thankfully, most of the compromises (such as no 3.5mm port option) Sony has made with the WH-CH520 haven’t been too crucial.\nThe lack of active noise cancellation might be more of a problem, but it certainly isn't unfair for the price. Where the WH-CH520 really shine is a very long battery life of 50 hours and premium features like a customizable control app with DSEE and multi-point audio pairing, which makes switching between devices a breeze.\nThey are made out of a textured plastic, which is sturdy but admittedly not that premium feeling. Although, again, this is a minor sacrifice for the audio smarts packed inside of them, plus the trade off with such a material is that they're lightweight. \nReleased in February 2023, they deliver balanced sound that has plenty of detail, making them easy to listen to. Sony really has stripped back features to focus on sound with the WH-CH520, and it really shows with deeper bass and brighter highs.\nFor those chasing something that is substantially more sturdy or sporting a 3.5mm port, you’re unlikely to find an alternative at the same price point ($60 / £60 / AU$99) that’s also wireless, let alone boasts great battery life and sound. \nRead our full Sony WH-CH520 review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You don't want to think about battery life: 60 hours of longevity per charge with ANC on and 100 without is truly exceptional.\n\n✅ You like an app with lots of options: Everything you need is here to customize your experience, including EQ settings.\n❌ You want best-in-class noise cancellation: The ANC here is very good, but the Sony WH-1000XM5 and especially the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones at #7 do it better.\n \n❌ You want light and portable: They're not big or heavy, but they don't fold up as much as they could and the accompanying case is a bit big.\nExpect enjoyable and highly engaging sound from the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 headphones, which we couldn’t fault for the price during our testing. In our review, we wrote: “There’s a stack of detail, a wide-open soundstaging, vaulting dynamic potency and an engaging, lively overall attitude that will keep you coming back for more.” You can also tweak the sound via the app, where you’ll find a seven-band equaliser with several presets.\nA pair of premium headphones like these will sound their absolute best with 16-bit/44.1kHz FLAC file action from Qobuz or Tidal, but that doesn’t mean they won’t also do a great job at making any music you throw at them sound incredible. As we wrote in our review: “They don’t judge – give them what you’ve got, and they’ll do their best with it.” The active noise cancellation isn’t the best (look to Bose for that), but it does a good job at nixing most noises – unless you’re looking for exceptional ANC, this will suit most people.\nThere’s a seriously impressive 100 hours of battery life on offer here, which is incredible. Even compared to some of the best rivals. Admittedly, that’s without ANC, but with ANC on, you’ll get 60 hours, which is still as good as it gets. You’d expect premium features for a premium price and won’t be disappointed. There’s multipoint connectivity onboard, Bluetooth 5.3, six mics to handle ANC, and an app packed with everything you’ll ever need. You’ll also find aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless codec compatibility. One rather unexpected but hilarious feature is that actor Matt Berry is one of the options for your ‘audible feedback’, which, in our review, we referred to as a “stroke of genius” – seriously, name a better voice actor for this role!\nThings are just as positive when it comes to their design. In our review, we wrote that these headphones are “flawlessly built and finished” with a combination of memory foam and vegan leather on the earpads and a padded headband. We also found them comfortable to wear. The only minor downside is that their travel case is a bit bigger than it needs to be. But really, we’re nit-picking. \nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 are priced at $279 / £229 / AU$479, which means they’re our top pick if your budget can stretch to the premium end of the spectrum – though it still isn't that premium compared to Sony and Bose's highest-end headphones, so they're actually good value. We awarded them five out of five stars in our review, which is a testament to how great these wonderfully-specced headphones sound and the wealth of features on offer.\nRead our full Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 review\nOur expert review:\n✅ Comfort and fit are important to you: These come with loads of different fitting options in the box, so you'll definitely get a secure, comfortable fit.\n\n✅ You want all the features: Triple-point connectivity is a useful world-first, and there's LDAC, customizable ANC, wireless charging… basically everything.\n❌ You need best-in-class noise cancellation: The ANC is perfectly average, but Bose's earbuds do a better job of cutting you off.\n\n❌ You want something small and light: They fit well, but they're still heavier than options such as AirPods Pro 2, and they're not small. \nThe Technics EAH-AZ80 are exactly the kind of package you want from a pair of premium earbuds. Not only do they sound fantastic, they come with some of the most advanced and future-proofed tech of any buds you can buy today, including debuting the first example of triple-device multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, meaning they can be connected to three devices at once and can move seamlessly between them – which worked great in our testing.\nYou've got Bluetooth 5.3 which can be compatible with next-gen LE Audio, you've got LDAC for CD-quality streaming from compatible devices, you've got highly tweakable noise cancellation and ambient sound modes, a great EQ, wireless charging… basically all the latest toys.\nEven more importantly, we're huge fans of their sound quality. It's so poised and eloquent, with a rich dynamic range that feels like you're getting a full and accurate reproduction of the recording. In our review, we said \""it's both swift and accurate, as well as balanced and detailed. It’s not quite as energetic as really high-end earbuds, but we can hardly blame it for that – the overall detail and accuracy is a cut above almost anything else.\""\nTechnics goes above and beyond to make sure that the earbuds fit all shapes and sizes of ears, providing seven silicone, drop-shaped eartips for their so-called 'concha-fit'.\nThe battery life and active noise cancellation are less exemplary – both are average, so not bad at all, but not exceptional – but they will be absolutely perfect for anyone looking for excellent musical fidelity and cutting-edge tech features from their earbuds.\nRead our full Technics EAH-AZ80 review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You want great ANC for less: The Ear (a) offer the best noise-stopping power we've heard for their price, hands down.\n\n✅ You want serious sound quality: The Ear (a) are a seriously fun and zealous listen, also with support for LDAC higher-res wireless tech.\n❌ You want spatial audio support: The similarly priced Sony WF-C700N offer this, but you won't find it here.\n\n❌ You want long battery life: 5.5 hours with noise cancellation is distinctly average – again, the Sony buds mentioned above offer 7.5 hours.\nNothing's latest affordable earbuds (which launched alongside the pricier Nothing Ear) are a seriously impressive bit of kit. In our Nothing Ear (a) review, we tested them directly against the Sony WF-C700N, which we previously recommended as our favorite buds at around the $100/$100 price. In our verdict, we said \""the Nothing earbuds look more premium and feel more foxy. Their noise cancellation is a touch more robust and the sound is every bit as energetic, detailed and zealous, and (dare we say it?) a tad more expansive to boot.\""\nSonic prowess is the star here. Our review praised the \""meaty and arresting\"" sound, noting that it does present less of a delicate hi-fi listen and more of the \""fun and energy\"", we want at the level – and very happy with it we were too. Naturally, spending more on the Technics (above) will get you a clear improvement in sound but, as we said while testing them, \""for the money, Nothing has tweaked its recipe to near perfection here.\""\nDid we mention how impressed we were with the active noise cancellation? It nixed basically all standard low-level constant noise during our testing, with only louder and more chaotic sounds breaking through. And thanks to features such as wearer detection (so they auto-pause when you take 'em out), multipoint pairing, LDAC hi-res audio support, plus the Nothing app for tweaking the EQ and other features, they're about as well-specced as anything around at the price. OK, the 5.5-hour battery life with ANC on isn't class-leading, but we're happy to overlook it for this level of performance – same with the lack of spatial audio support. Honestly, e don't mind at all, not when you're getting such good value in the essentials, as well as other nice features.\nRead our full Nothing Ear (a) review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You want super-cheap buds that don't feel that way: The sound is better than it has any right to be for such a low price, and they're very well made and pleasant to wear.\n\n✅ You like a dash of style: You can get these with some fun color twists, unlike so many earbuds that want to come in black or gray only. (But they do come in black.)\n❌ You need all the latest features: There are very affordable earbuds, such as the Earfun Air Pro 3, that are packed with smart tech, including ANC. These are not.\n\n❌ Sound quality is important: These sound incredibly for the price, but the price is very low. The Audio-Technica ATH-SQ1TW sound much better, but are still affordable.\nThe JLab Go Air Pop are basically as cheap as wireless earbuds can go currently without becoming pointless (if you need to go cheaper, go wired for the best value), and yet they'll never feel like a rock bottom purchase. They're unreasonably good for their price – in our review, we called them \""emphatically unbeatable for this money\"".\nYou can find them for around $20 / £20 / AU$49.95, and sometimes even cheaper during sales events. And yet, our review said: \""What you should know is that JLab’s solution beats anything in its price range for sound, hands down. It can even stand toe to toe with the more expensive Sony WF-C500\"". While Sony's buds do have an extra edge on the sound, it's close, and that's a serious achievement for something less than half the price.\nWhere the sound wavers is a slightly harsh treble, but bass and mid-range are both well-handled, and the higher notes are still good for the majority of the time. And again, nothing that costs the same actually does it better.\nThey're light on features (no ANC, no aptX, no multipoint), but they have what you really need, including on-ear volume controls, and three EQ profiles that are worth experiment with.\nThe battery life of eight hours in the buds is perfectly respectable, and an additional 24 hours from the case, for 32 hours total – again, this is higher than we'd expect from something at this price.\nAnd they're very lightweight and comfortable too, with no rough seams or anything that you might be afraid of in an inexpensive wearable. They feel durable too, though we don't love the built-in charging cable (we get the idea – it's always ready to go! – but it means you're stuck needing an old USB charger instead of a new USB-C one).\nOur expert review:\n✅ You want the best noise cancellation: That's the long and short of it. They're the best. A clear step up over anything else (except the Bose QuietComfort Headphones, which are 95% as good).\n\n✅ You want exciting, nuanced, rich sound:\nThese are Bose's best-sounding headphones by a long way – they're wonderfully dynamic and detailed.\n❌ You want a long battery life: The 24 hours of battery life here is pretty disappointing – not a dealbreaker, but below Sony and way below Cambridge Audio.\n\n❌ You want Hi-Res Audio connectivity: Despite a high cost, there's no USB-C Hi-Res option, and no broad aptX or LDAC support. \nThese are Bose's most exciting headphones in years, and they put the inventor of active noise cancellation right back on top of the category it created. They're in a class of their own when it comes to blocking outside sound, and we tested then on planes, trains, buses, in bustling cities, in the office, and at home – and in all cases, they silence the create was more complete than anything else we've tried (though obviously, some stuff will still leak through).\nBut what's so exciting is that on top of this, they also sound simply fantastic. As we said in our review: \""They deliver some of the most alive, exciting, textured, finely resolved, deeply engaging music I've ever heard from a pair of wireless headphones.\"" This sound quality comes at a premium, but we think they're easily worth the higher price over the likes of the Sony or Cambridge Audio headphones here. \""The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones may not be cheap, but on the music quality alone, I think they're a great deal,\"" our review says.\nThey also have some good smart features, including customizable active noise cancellation modes and multipoint connectivity, controlled from the generally intuitive Bose Music app.\nIt's a bit of a shame that higher-quality audio support is limited to Snapdragon Sound with compatible phones, and the 3.5mm audio cable. Several audiophile competitors (the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 in this guide, and the Shure Aonic 50 Gen 2) have USB-C audio support for serious hi-res files, and aptX for broader high-quality wireless tech (or LDAC). \nThe 24-hour battery life is also lower than the 30 hours that's standard for noise-cancelling headphones, and massively lower than the 60 hours for the Cambridge Audio headphones in this list. But we can forgive all these faults for the sound quality on offer here.\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You need elite active noise cancellation: For the price, these have the best ANC in earbuds that you can get.\n\n✅ You love a balanced and accurate sound: Bose has really nailed the sound range of these buds, providing a detailed and natural mix.\n❌ You want higher-res audio: There's no aptX or LDAC support here, so it's standard Bluetooth connections only.\n\n❌ You like a smaller, lighter earbud: These are smaller than Bose's last offering, but it's still chunkier than average, and you do feel it in your ear.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 aren't Bose's latest earbuds, but we're think they're the best value for noise-stopping power. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are newer and arguably even better at stopping noise, but they cost a lot more for not a ton of improvement, so we think most people should still look to this model.\nAnd that's partly because they still block noise better than basically anything else, despite being older. We noted in our review that you need the right fit to get their full effectiveness, but when you've got that, they're incredibly powerful. And best of all, this silence doesn't negatively impact sound quality. In our review, we wrote: \""We can’t stress this enough – the sound is very well balanced, with a heck of a lot of detail and texture coming through. And if you still find you need to tweak it, you can via the EQ in the app.\""\nThey're a bit more of a mixed bag when it comes to feature. The Bose Music app means you can customize things like the ANC levels, which we like, and the EQ if you're so inclined (but we don't think you'll need to). But there's no higher-res audio support from aptX or LDAC, and no multipoint audio connection. The battery life is also very average at six hours from the buds, and 18 hours from the case (for 24 hours total).\nStill, these things may not matter so much to you – we're clearly happy to forgive them. If you want a quiet commute from a great-sound pair of earbuds, here you go.\nTo save some money on Bose products, check out our Bose voucher codes. \nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You want to listen in Hi-Res: The wired USB-C mode is capable of making the most of lossless music files, while there's aptX Adaptive for CD-quality wireless.\n\n✅ You want elite sound at any price: No other wireless cans deliver such great levels of detail, refinement and expansiveness. \n❌ You want the best ANC out there: The noise cancellation here is not very advanced, and lacks customization options.  \n\n❌ You like light and portable headphones: They're pretty heavy at 350g (though they are comfortable), and they don't fold up small for travel. \nAs a debut pair of wireless headphones, Focal hit the nail on the head with the Bathys. The French audio specialist has been known in the market to make some of the best over-ear headphones out there and the Bathys embody a lot of its expertise and experience but in a more versatile way with its wireless capabilities. \nThe ability to access uncompromising, high-end sound through USB-C wired DAC mode does mean that these headphones don’t come cheap, though. In terms of price, they sit a level above even the likes of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones or the Apple AirPods Max – but so does the sound. In our review, we said \""vocals are every bit as three dimensional as they should be\"", and that \""the Bathys deliver low end with agility and panache. Anything we throw at these can is beautifully held in check throughout, across the frequencies.\""\nWhile the sound in these headphones is faultless, we did find some niggles during our testing around the overall build quality. Although very minor, the physical buttons and headband can be a bit flimsy and distracting. \nBut if you value sound over all else then it’s hard to beat the Focal Bathys for pure high-end audio. They also come packed with premium features, including a control app, though the active noise cancellation is nothing to write home about compared to Bose and Sony options.\nRead our full Focal Bathys review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You like the luxe experience: With beautiful metal finishing and rich leather, these feel premium and beautifully built.\n\n✅ You want stunning sound: These are as good as the Focal Bathys for sheer audio quality – they're supremely expansive, natural and insightful.\n❌ You want light, travel-friendly cans: Much like the Focal above, these are fairly weighty and don't fold up for traveling. \n\n❌ You want high-end noise cancellation: The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are a huge improvement on these for noise blocking.\nAnother one for the audiophile crowd, the sound quality of these headphones is right up there with the Focal Bathys as being the best we've heard from wireless headphones. Bowers & Wilkins' history is in full force here, bringing the refined, hi-fi-like sound quality you'd expect from the company – but it comes with a high price.\nIn our review, we said these headphones \""sound as three-dimensional and energetic as we've heard in a wireless design\"", with an \""agile and expansive midrange\"" and \""expressive and weighty\"" low end. Compared to the likes of the Sony WH-1000XM5, we said that \""The extra energy, depth, emotional oomph and overall immersion in excellent-quality music place the PX8 in a different league.\"" And we love both those headphones, but you pay twice as much, and you'll hear the difference.\nAnd you don't just hear it. The premium design is what we've promoted these headphones for here, and they're a beautiful balance of subtlety and flair, thanks to their used of diamond-cut aluminum details and sumptuous Nappa leather for comfort. (Sorry, vegans, though the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones feature only synthetic leather, and are fantastic.) \nThe PX8 are more average when it comes to battery life (30 hours is exactly what we consider the norm) and the active noise cancellation (it's effective, but it's behind Sony and Bose's best). But it has some great smart features, including good control via its app, and USB-C audio support for truly Hi-Res Audio, as well as aptX Adaptive for CD-quality sound wirelessly.\nThey may be expensive, but they offer so much quality, and with a gorgeous design that really feels worth that outlay, and looks closer to an objet d'art than the competition.\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins PX8 review\nOur expert review:\n✅ You want uncompromising sound: Audio quality is where the Triple Drivers stand out, delivering a balanced yet detailed sound with mid-bass.   \n\n✅ You want the best possible value: At this price range, it's hard to find headphones that can match the level of quality build and design you're getting.  \n❌ You don't like wires: The biggest gripe we had with these headphones is that the rubber cable would catch on itself, which can be distracting when listening on the go.\n\n❌ You value quality materials: Another minor flaw we found during our testing was that the plastic remote feels cheap, like the rubber material used for the cable.   \nThese deliver fantastic sound and equally fantastic value for money. The audio quality in the 1MORE Triple Drivers truly does shine above the rest for its balanced sound. It has a slightly warm signature beat that we grew to love.  \nWe consider them to be the best headphones for the price, especially if you prefer wired earbuds. For $100 / £100 (about AU$168), it’s hard to find a better-sounding and more well-built pair of earphones than the 1MORE Triple Drivers. \nThe biggest nitpick we had during our testing was that the rubber cables can catch on themselves as well as your clothes. As an alternative, if you want a little extra refinement and more luxurious materials, the same firm's 1MORE Quad Drivers are even more impressive, albeit at twice the price.\nAt this price, with such excellent build and design, it’s hard to fault the Triple Drivers. The inbuilt remote feels a little cheap, but that's more than made up for by the lush sound quality offered by these luxe-looking earbuds. For the price, you can't do better than 1MORE's Triple Driver in-ear headphones. \nRead our full 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphone review\nOn the bench in August 2024, we had the Edifier Stax Spirit S5, an excellent pair of headphones sonically thanks in no small part to the fact that they're both wireless and planar magnetic. But (and this is a big but) there's no ANC processing, which is the only reason they don't feature in this more general headphones roundup. We also put the aspirational Final D7000 through their paces and these are excellent (and huge) cans, but they're a wired proposition – and you'll need deep pockets. Then, there's the Creative Zen Hybrid SXFI, which one might add as 'best for spatial audio in music' but they are let down (just fractionally) by the ineffective ANC, but if you really want immersive audio, they're still worth a look. \nWe also recently reviewed the biggest recent headphones launch: the Sonos Ace. Sonos' first headphones are a very premium price, and have a design to match. But the audio quality for music is a step behind the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones we recommend above. However, we absolutely loved them for their movie performance and spatial audio, either when used with a Sonos soundbar or with any Dolby Atmos-capable device – if you're a big movie fan, you should still read our Sonos Ace review.\nYou might notice that the Sony WH-1000MX5 aren't represented here, despite being the flagship headphones of one of the biggest names. We really like these headphones, as you can see in our five-star Sony WH-1000MX5 review – but they're beaten in key areas by other products that are keeping them out of this guide, essentially. The Cambridge Audio Melomania P100, for example, are better-sounding and offer twice the battery life, while also being less expensive. It's a cut-throat world of headphones.\nAnd our Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review is also here, and deliver super sound quality and active noise cancellation, along with some great features when combined with recent Samsung phones. But at the price, they didn't quite push the hot competition out of the way – though we certainly recommend them for Samsung phone owners. Their biggest issue, really, is that the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are so good, and are still available for around half the price of the new buds!\nOne of the key parts of being able to choose the best headphones for you is knowing what you're talking/reading about. There's a lot of jargon around headphones, so here's an explanation of all the key terms you'll need to know when buying headphones today.\n3.5mm jack: The classic wired connection for headphones – not all of today’s wireless headphones support this, though, so we make sure to highlight it, for when only wired use will do.\nActive noise cancellation (ANC): A way of processing audio to counteract extraneous sounds around you and remove them from what you’re hearing. Microphones on the outside of the headphones listen for ambient external sounds, then create an ‘antiphase’ (often called ‘anti-noise’) soundwave, which is mixed into your music to ‘cancel out’ the ambient noise. This means you can listen to music at lower volume levels, or can hear podcasts more clearly.\naptX: A higher-quality audio streaming system from compatible devices, that works over Bluetooth, but is capable of streaming higher-resolution files. There are multiple versions of aptX, but in new headphones you are mostly likely to see aptX Adaptive, which can work at different quality levels depending on connection strength. You may also see a reference to aptX Lossless, which is part of aptX Adaptive, and is the highest-quality connection the tech currently offers. There is also aptX Voice, which is designed to make your voice clearer on calls, and is also part of aptX Adaptive.\nAuracast: A new Bluetooth connection system, still in its early stages. It enables you to connect Auracast-ready headphones to any Auracast transmission source without needing to ‘pair’ your headphones in the usual Bluetooth method, meaning that you could connect to a TV in a bar to hear a sports game, or connect to your airport gate to hear announcements. It was developed for hearing-aid use, but will be supported by a large number of headphones due to its convenience.\nBluetooth: The technology that effectively all headphones rely on for a wireless connection. It is capable of supporting many different music streaming technologies, including aptX, LDAC and LHDC. The two standard and most common streaming technologies are called SBC and AAC, and are supported on the vast majority of earbuds. There are many different versions of Bluetooth, and higher versions enable newer features such as Bluetooth LE Audio or Auracast – however, supporting a new version of Bluetooth doesn’t guarantee that these technologies are supported, so always check the specs. Bluetooth 5.4 is the latest version at the time of writing, though Bluetooth 5.3 is more common, and supports every major Bluetooth feature.\nBluetooth LE Audio: The next-gen version of Bluetooth’s standard music streaming technology, which is technically called LC3. LC3 is capable of delivering higher-quality music than SBC or AAC while using less power – or much higher quality at the same level of power use. There are limited models that currently support LE Audio, and even fewer phones that support it. We hope that will change in the future.\nDolby Atmos: A spatial audio format used in both music and movies. Instead of music being encoded into ‘channels’, different parts of the audio are encoded as ‘objects’ that can be positioned in 3D space, meaning that they can be heard in specific and realistic positions. \nDrivers: The part of the headphones that make the sound – often called speakers. The type used on almost all headphones and earbuds are ‘dynamic’ drivers, which are the traditional cone-shaped speakers you see on loudspeakers, just smaller (usually between 5mm and 13mm on earbuds, and between 20mm and 50mm on headphones). However, some headphones use ‘planar magnetic’ drivers, which are more precise and favored by audiophiles, but are typically more expensive and harder to produce.\nEQ: This is the short term for ‘equalizer’, which is a way to adjust the sound balance of a pair of headphones, to enable you to increase or decrease the bass tones, mid-range and treble. Many wireless headphones these days come with an app that enables you to control the EQ, either by choosing presents for different genres (such as rock, classical or pop), or by giving you a series of sliders to adjust these frequencies yourself. EQs are split into ‘bands’, so a three-band EQ has three sliders: one for bass, one for mid, one for treble. A nine-band EQ has nine sliders, giving you finer control across the sound range. \nHi-Res Audio: High-resolution audio is music that has been digitally stored with much more information in the file than the more compressed versions you get if you use MP3 files, or stream from Spotify. We have a whole guide on what Hi-Res Audio is, but the idea is that you can hear more detail in your music, so they’re closer to the original recordings. Hi-Res files also tend to offer more dynamic range, and expansiveness, so they sound more natural. This all depends on the headphones being good enough to express this extra quality level, of course – you will find that many headphones are ‘Hi-Res Certified’, but this is just on a technical level, not a quality level. Most of the best streaming services support some kind of Hi-Res Audio files now, though they’re a lot larger than the lower-quality files we’re used to before, so some services won’t default to playing these files unless you’re on a Wi-Fi network.\nIn-ear: This means that a pair of earbuds has tips that fit into your ear canal. You may see the term ‘IEM’ used, which means ‘In-ear monitor’ – this is a particular kind of in-ear bud favored by professionals, and it’s often used even in consumer wired earbuds to say that a pair of earbuds is very high-quality and will have a very noise-isolating fit.\nFind My: Both Apple and Android phones have a system that enables them to find lost devices, and some headphones support this. On iPhones, it’s simply called Find My. On Android, it’s called Find My Device. Some headphones have a custom version of this feature based on their app, rather than the version built into the phone software. The built-in version is strongly preferable.\nHead tracking: On headphones that support spatial audio, head tracking is an additional piece of processing whereby the headphones can detect the movement of your head from the source device, and use it to make the 3D sound of Dolby Atmos or other spatial formats feel more true to life. It means that the sound you’re listening to doesn’t have to move with you when you move your head – it can sound more like you’re sitting in a room of speakers, even when you’re wearing headphones.\nLDAC: This is a higher-quality music streaming technology that works over Bluetooth, much like aptX. It was developed by Sony, and is heavily supported by the company’s products, and support is possible on Android phones, and many of the best portable music players.\nLHDC: This is another higher-quality music streaming technology, and a rival to aptX and LDAC: It is also possible for Android phones to support it.\nLossless: Lossless music is essentially music that has been streamed/transmitted using technology that doesn’t lose detail from the original file. The original files of a music recording are very large, and must be reduced for efficient streaming or download. MP3 is a ‘lossy’ technology, which means it removes information from the track in order to make it much smaller. Other file types, such as FLAC (used by Tidal) and ALAC (used by Apple Music) are lossless, which means that the files are larger than MP3, but they retain all the original audio information. Read more in our dedicated audio file format explainer. \nMulti-point Bluetooth: A newer Bluetooth feature that enables your headphones to be paired with two (or even three, in rare cases) devices at the same time, so you can switch between them instantly, without needing to disconnect and reconnect, or re-pair, your headphones each time.\nNoise isolation: This refers to the passive ability of a pair of headphones or earbuds to isolate you from ambient sounds, without using the processing of active noise cancellation. So it refers to the way that earbuds also act like earplugs to block outside sound, or the way that over-ear headphones provide a seal around your ears to do the same thing.\nOn-ear: An on-ear fit refers to headphones with a small earpad that sits directly on your auricle (the part of the ear that’s outside the head). This tends to provide a less-perfect seal for noise isolation than over-ear headphones, and some find it less comfortable – but some prefer it.\nOver-ear: An over-ear fit means the earpads of the headphones are larger, and sit around your auricle, so your whole ear is encompassed within their seal. This is the fit of choice for the best noise-cancelling headphones, because it provides the best passive noise isolation, which they can then enhance with active noise cancellation.\nPlanar magnetic: This type of speaker driver can be more precise and dynamic than the dynamic drivers used in most headphones, and is a favorite of audiophiles. However, it’s expensive and hard to power, meaning that headphones that use it tend to be heavy and pricey.\nSnapdragon Sound: This is a combination of wireless technologies designed to provide a better experience if you have both a phone and pair of headphones that support it. It combines the higher-quality streaming of aptX with other features designed to reduce the latency of the Bluetooth connection (ie, how long it takes to transmit the sound), to improve the quality of voice calls, and to improve the overall reliability of the connection. ‘Snapdragon’ is a series of chips made by Qualcomm, and are used in many Android phones. Read more in our in-depth Snapdragon Sound explainer. \nSpatial audio: A generic term used to describe various types of 3D sound technologies used in headphones. Apple uses it to refer to its own particular mix of Dolby Atmos support with head tracking. Other brands may use it for equivalent features, but there’s no rule as to exactly what it means, other than that the idea is to make the sound feel like it’s coming from all around you, not right in your ears – think Dirac Virtuo, DTS:X, THX and of course Dolby Atmos. It’s especially good with movies, where it can recreate the home theater experience in headphones.\nTransparency mode: A variation of active noise cancellation. Instead of blocking the outside noise, the processing actually mixes ambient noise into your music intelligently, so you can hear what’s going on around you without overwhelming your music. That way, you can hear a train announcement, have a conversation, or be aware of traffic. Different manufacturers call this mode different things – it may be something like ‘Aware mode’, “HearThru’ or ‘Ambient mode’. We tend to call it ‘Transparency mode’ as a rule, to make it easy to compare products in our guide.\nUSB-C Audio: Some headphones offer the ability to play digital audio from a computer or phone when connected by a USB-C cable, and the advantage of this is that it can support extremely high-quality resolution tracks – far beyond what any version of Bluetooth currently supports. For audiophiles, a pair of headphones that can do both wireless for convenience and USB-C Audio for wired Hi-Res Audio playback, can be preferential.\nThere's a lot to consider when you're buying a new pair of headphones. But the most important is the design. This doesn't just dictate how they look, but the features on offer, how they feel when you wear them and how you'll use them day-to-day.\nWe've selected both over-ear headphones and earbuds here, though we have separate guides to just the best wireless headphones of the on-head style, or the best wireless earbuds, if you want to narrow it down.\nIn-ear headphones, also called earbuds or earphones, are usually the cheapest and easiest way to pump audio into your ears. They rest in or just outside the ear canal, creating a tight seal to keep air out and sound in. These are the most discreet designs you'll find, making them excellent for portability and the prime choice for athletes.\nOver-ear headphones generally provide fantastic richness and depth of sound, which allows listeners to pick apart the instruments and sounds much easier. Additionally, over-ear, or circumaural headphones, go around the ear and offer a generous amount of padding.\nInstead of enveloping your ears, on-ear headphones create a light, breathable seal around your ear. The noise isolation is less effective than in-ear or over-ear options.\nSome headphones don't go anywhere near your ears at all. Bone-conducting headphones send vibrations through your cheekbones and jaw up towards your inner ear, leaving your ears free. These headphones make great running headphones and swimming headphones.\nWith wireless on-ear headphones and over-ear headphones, you simply lose the wire connecting them to your device – otherwise, they look pretty much the same as your regular pair of wired cans, and give you the noise-isolating prowess of over-ears without the need for cumbersome wires to connect to your device.\nTrue wireless earbuds have no cord whatsoever. For some, this means true freedom; for others, untethered true wireless means constant danger of losing their expensive audio kit down the drain – or terrible connections. The latter, at least, has changed now – thanks to advances in Bluetooth technology like aptX HD, the best true wireless earbuds have never sounded better. \nFor more information about how to choose your next headphones, read our comprehensive guide, which goes into this in more detail. We also have other guides for getting the most out of your headphones, including how to care for them – be sure to check out our how to clean your wireless earbuds walkthrough to make sure they're spick and span. \nNope! In fact, some people choose them because they can help to protect your hearing over time. Active noise cancellation uses something called \""anti-noise\"" to help block outside sounds – essentially, they use microphones on the outside to listen to the world around you, then calculate the opposite of those noise frequencies, and pump those into their sound to \""cancel\"" out the sounds around you. This is makes it easier to hear what your headphones are playing – and that means you don't have to turn the volume up as loud. This is how they can protect your hearing long term: listening to loud headphones all the time is a serious issue for people who've been doing it for years, and with ANC headphones, you can keep it lower.\nBose and Sony have very high reputations, and for good reason. They both make very high-performance products for the price, with good build quality even with plastic construction (which has the advantage of being lightweight and comfortable).\nBeats is obviously a famous brand, and its products are very well-made, and the sound is strong these days. Apple's headphones are much-loved, especially AirPods Pro 2, which are extremely high quality and well-priced compared to other premium earbuds.\nAt the higher end, Bowers and Wilkins makes fantastic headphones with premium materials, as does Sennheiser (which also makes some good affordable products).\nFor cheaper products, we rate JBL, Anker Soundcore, JLab and 1More all highly – all these products feel well-made, but tend to be ad the affordable end of the market.\n☑️ More than 2,400 audio reviews\n☑️ 15 years of product testing\n☑️ Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n☑️ Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWhen it comes to the best headphones, we focus on sound quality above everything else. We look at both wired and wireless cans and earbuds that would appeal to audiophiles, as well as those working in professional roles. However, we also appreciate that budget is important too, so we compare like for like, picking out budget headphones that perform admirably for the price.\nWe also look at other features such as ANC, battery life, fit, and of course the usability and extra perks offered by any companion apps. Of course, design and whether they look (and feel) good all adds to the model's desirability – and this is noted as we listen to music across a wide range of genres over several days. \nWe have tested all of the headphones in this guide extensively, spending plenty of time analyzing the sound, fit, design, specs, and value for money so that you will be able to choose a product you'll be over the moon with. \nWhile there are many different factors that go into testing headphones, we make sure to use a variety of sources to give as much variety as possible. These range from using various Bluetooth codecs and Wi-Fi to listen to different music steaming services, DACs, portable digital audio players and more.    \nSeptember 9, 2024 \nUpdated our intro to reflect new features and perks within the newest headphones around.

However, it can be overwhelming to sort through the hundreds of products on the market. Some headphones even seem to offer similar performances but at radically different price points. How do you know which pair is right for you?\nWe've tested over 805 pairs of headphones, and below are our recommendations for the best you can buy.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Wireless are the best headphones we've tested. These premium over-ears have a fantastic noise isolation performance thanks to their active noise cancelling (ANC) system. Similar to other headphones from this manufacturer, they block out a wide range of ambient sound, from rumbly bus and plane engines to ambient chit-chat and noisy computer fans. With the ANC on, they last 29 hours continuously. These headphones also have a very comfortable fit, so you can wear them for long periods without fatigue.\nOut of the box, their bassy sound adds extra thump, rumble, and boom to your mixes. If you don't like that sound, you can adjust it to suit your tastes using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. The app also offers Immersive Audio, a feature that tracks your head movements to create a more spacious and immersive audio experience compared to their default soundstage. They have a few more extra features that add to their versatility. You can connect them with up to two devices simultaneously, and they support aptX Adaptive. This Bluetooth codec automatically adjusts its performance to your content, ensuring low latency when watching videos and high sound quality when listening to audio. When the connection is consistent, they also support aptX Lossless for even better audio quality.\nFor more wireless headphones, check out our picks for the best wireless Bluetooth headphones.\nSee our review\nIf you're looking for premium over-ears at a more digestible price, check out the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless instead. While Sony has released a newer edition of these headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless, they're less comfortable for most people, and their ANC doesn't block out as much noise in the bass range. Plus, if you're looking for a premium performance at a lower price, they're usually cheaper than their successor.\nThe XM4 headphones have an outstanding ANC system that does a remarkable job of filtering ambient sound, including rumbling engines and background conversations, so they're a great choice for commuting or traveling. Their battery lasts for roughly 37 hours with the ANC on, so you don't need to worry about running out of power during long days on the go. Their mic doesn't offer the best recording quality, making your voice sound thin and muffled.\nLike the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Wireless, they support multi-device pairing and have a bass-heavy default sound profile that emphasizes thump and rumble in genres like EDM and hip-hop. That said, it's more muddy and cluttered-sounding than the Bose's, and even with a graphic EQ and presets in their companion app, it can be tricky to tamp down the extra bass. That said, the app also offers a virtual soundstage feature called 360 Reality Audio, which analyzes your ear's unique shape to create a personalized, immersive sound. However, you have to subscribe to services like TIDAL that support it.\n Check out our article on the best noise cancelling headphones for more picks.\nSee our review\nFrom this price point onwards, Anker dominates the market. Their Q lineup covers a range of prices, from mid-range down to budget, and most options are pretty hard to ignore since they come well-equipped with features like ANC, multi-device pairing, and companion app support. Their top-of-the-line model is the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless, which are significantly cheaper than the Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless. These headphones are a step down in build quality and comfort from the previous pick and offer a shorter continuous battery life. Still, they supply some of the same features and have a comparable noise cancelling performance. Their adjustable ANC does a fantastic job of cutting down a wide range of sound. On the downside, they self-generate noise with the ANC on, which is noticeable and can be a bit annoying.\nTheir V-shaped sound is well-suited for genres like pop and rock, as they have extra bass and treble to give mixes extra thump and rumble while still ensuring that vocals and instruments pop. You can tweak their sound using an in-app graphic EQ and presets. These over-ears also last for around 27 hours continuously and support multi-device pairing, so you can stay connected to your PC and smartphone simultaneously. On the downside, if you're using these over-ears for calls, their mic has a mediocre recording quality, so speech is thin, dark, and lacking depth, but it handles background noise quite well.\nIf you're looking for a similar set of headphones with a better microphone, check out the Sony ULT WEAR Wireless. These noise cancelling headphones supply a better mic, slightly better build quality, and a longer battery life. They're also similarly tuned to favor a roughly similar bass-heavy sound profile. However, while their ANC is excellent, they don't cancel low rumbling noise as handily as the Anker and cost more.\nLooking for more mid-range headphones? Our article on the best headphones under $200 has more picks!\nSee our review\nIf you're looking for a cheaper pair of headphones, check out the Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Wireless. While they aren't as sturdy or feature-packed as the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless, they still have ANC and are just as comfortable for long listening sessions. These budget over-ears last longer than their more expensive counterpart at over 44 hours on a single charge. As such, you can use them during long trips or repeat days at the office without needing a recharge.\nThey have an excited sound profile out of the box that complements genres like rock and pop. However, the extra bass muddies mixes, and the added treble makes content sound harsh and piercing. Still, you can fine-tune their sound using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. While they don't have adaptive noise cancelling like the Q45, so they can't automatically adjust to your environment, their ANC has three modes to best suit your needs. They support multi-device pairing, so you can stay connected to up to two devices at a time. If you like to crank the volume up, others around you may hear it. Their integrated mic also really struggles to separate speech from noise, so your voice can be drowned out.\nIf you aren't looking to spend much, our best budget and cheap headphones article will give you more recommendations for low-priced options.\nSee our review\nIf you want the best sound experience over a Bluetooth connection, check out the Focal Bathys Wireless. They're much more pricy than the previous wireless picks, but these over-ears are equipped with handy features to improve your audio experience. Like our top pick, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Wireless, they support aptX Adaptive codec, allowing you to stream high-quality audio over Bluetooth. Although their ANC isn't as powerful as our top pick, their sound is more consistent between wearers. Using these wired lets you take advantage of their USB-DAC mode, converting digital signals to analog in high resolution. They also last over 29 hours continuously and have a comfortable, plush fit, which is great for long listening sessions.\nUsing the Dynamic EQ preset, they have a fairly neutral sound profile and deliver satisfying bass without drowning out vocals and instruments. Their companion app offers a graphic EQ and presets to help you adjust their sound to suit your tastes. While they're closed-back headphones, and their passive soundstage doesn't feel the most spacious or natural, they're equipped with an ANC system to help cut down ambient sound around you. They also support multi-device pairing, so you can stay connected to your PC and smartphone simultaneously, making them versatile without sacrificing sound quality.\nWant more sound-oriented headphones? Try our picks for the top headphones for music.\nSee our review\nThe Sennheiser HD 800 S are audiophile headphones that blow their competitors out of the water. Unlike the Focal Bathys Wireless, which are closed-back Bluetooth headphones, these wired cans have an open-back design, allowing audio to escape the ear cups and bounce off the walls around you, creating a spacious, out-of-head passive soundstage. On the flip side, they're designed for use in an enclosed room as they won't block out any background noise. You'll need to purchase a high-grade amp if you want to properly drive them, which can be an additional investment if you don't already have one. If you just want to dip your toes into the audiophile world, it's worth trying out entry-level headphones like the Philips SHP9600, which are much cheaper but have a less immersive soundstage.\nThe Sennheiser headphones have a well-balanced, neutral sound suitable for most audio content. Although they have trouble reproducing a thumpy low bass, they have a touch of extra high bass to add warmth to the audio. Their mid-range is flat, so vocals and lead instruments are clearly and accurately reproduced. They also have excellent build quality, and their fit is comfortable enough for long listening sessions.\nIf you're looking for more options for hi-fi sound, check out our article on the best audiophile headphones.\nSee our review\nIf you're looking for lightweight, more portable headphones than our previous over-ear picks, try the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless. Their small design makes it easy to stash them in your pockets when you're on the go. Thanks to their ANC feature, they also have excellent noise isolation performance. However, their memory foam ear tips largely do the heavy lifting, passively blocking out a wide range of sounds from engine rumbles to passenger chit-chat. As a result, some people may not find a significant difference between ANC on and off. With their ANC on, they last nearly nine hours, but there are a couple of extra charges in the case if you need them.\nOut of the box, they have a warm sound profile that you can fine-tune to your liking using their companion app's graphic EQ and presets. That said, not everyone will enjoy the memory foam ear tips, which can put pressure on your ear canal. If you're looking for more comfortable noise cancelling buds, consider the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Truly Wireless instead. Their ear tips have a shallower fit and put less pressure on the ear. However, unlike the Sony headphones, they don't support multi-device pairing, so you can't stay connected with multiple devices simultaneously.\nSearching for more earbuds? Check out our best in-ear headphones article!\nSee our review\nWant something that rivals the Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless but offers extra features for iOS users? Then the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless are a solid choice. While they don't block out as much background noise as the Sony, these popular buds have an H2 chip for seamless pairing with your MacBook or iPhone. They also support Spatial Audio, which creates an immersive audio experience with supported content, which is great because the buds themselves struggle to simulate an out-of-head soundstage due to their design.\nThese comfortable, well-built headphones are certified IPX4 for resistance against water splashes. Their warm sound adds a touch of extra bass, while vocals and instruments are cozy within the tracks. Unfortunately, they don't have any sound customization features to help you adjust their sound to your liking. Some people find that the buds wiggle out of their ears over time, which can be annoying. Their call performance could be better, too, as the mic struggles to capture speech clearly. Still, they last under six hours continuously, and their carrying case holds an extra four charges if needed.\nThese earbuds have two variants: one with a Lightning charging port and another with a USB-C charging port. The version with the Lightning port case has been replaced with the USB-C port case, so it's more a matter of availability and personal preference.\nFor more iOS-friendly options, check out our picks for the best wireless earbuds for iPhone.\nSee our review\n\n\nAug 07, 2024:\n                We've made small edits to the text for clarity but haven't changed our picks.\n              \n\n\nJun 11, 2024:\n                The Sony ULT WEAR Wireless have been added as an alternative to the Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless, and a note about charging cases was added to the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) Truly Wireless.\n              \n\n\nMay 08, 2024:\n                We've checked our picks to ensure they still represent the best in each category but have made no changes.\n              \n\n\nApr 09, 2024:\n                We've validated this article's picks and made minor changes to the text to ensure accuracy.\n              \n\n\nMar 11, 2024:\n                This article has been checked for accuracy without any changes to the picks.

From in-ear buds to over-ear headphones, there are just so many options for headphones that offer great sound quality and other benefits like active noise canceling, wired vs wireless headsets, portability and more. With all the choices out there it's hard to choose just one set of headphones to call the best overall pair of headphones. The Sonos Ace, Sony WH-1000XM5, Sony WF-1000XM5, Apple AirPods Pro 2, Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds and Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones definitely have standout features worth looking into. \nOver the last 20 years, I've reviewed hundreds of headphones and earbuds. I've fully reviewed or had hands-on listening time with all headphones and earbuds on this list. Although we have options at several different prices, we tend to highlight more affordable headphones or at least models that cost $500 or less. If you're looking for the best sound and have the budget for it, you can go for options like the Focal Bathys, Bowers & Wilkins PX8 and Beyerdynamic Xelento Wireless (2nd generation), which deliver outstanding sound quality. \n \n    SCORE\n  \nBose's new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones may not be a huge upgrade over the company's Noise Cancelling 700 headphones, they feature a more premium design along with Bose's new Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also superb for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. All that adds up to a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max.\n \n    SCORE\n  \nWhen you have a product that a lot of people love, change can be risky. Such is the case for Sony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design, but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher $330 price tag ($80 more than the WH-1000XM4), most of those changes are good, and Sony's made some dramatic improvements with voice-calling performance, as well as even better noise canceling and more refined sound.\n \n    SCORE\n  \nWhen Sony's WF-1000XM4 earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise-canceling, sound and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. At $278 -- $20 more than their predecessor -- they're costly, too. Overall, they're really impressive; they are easily among the very top earbuds on the market.\nEarfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its new-for-2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but click the $10 instant coupon on their product page and add the code EWPROCNET at checkout and the price drops to $56. While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less.\nThey're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphone and other compatible devices. I also like that they come with a hard case and a cable for wired listening (though noise-canceling is disabled when you go wired, which is a bit of a bummer).\n \n    SCORE\n  \nWhile the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over Bose's excellent QC Earbuds 2 that were released in 2022, they're definitely a little better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. A natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and their new Immersive Audio feature opens up the sound a bit.\nSeveral years in development, Sonos' new Ace headphones are finally available. They're mostly very impressive, though they aren't without a few downsides, including a rather high price tag of $399 and some potential glitches with a key feature. Overall they're very well designed and also deliver top-notch sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance.\n \n    SCORE\n  \nSony's improved entry-level noise-canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s. They sound more premium than they look (and feel), and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Perhaps for some people, yes. The good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these should see significant discounts in the not-so-distant future, which is what you may want to wait for.\n \n    SCORE\n  \nLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them -- they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. That's not quite accurate, due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. Read our full review to find out what makes these very good headphones, albeit with some caveats.\nEdifier makes some good-sounding PC speakers and true-wireless earbuds and it's done a nice job with its W820NB noise-canceling headphones, now on their second-gen version, the Edifier W820NB Plus. \nThe first thing you'll notice about them when you put them on is that they're comfortable. Edifier has upgraded the ear pads with higher-grade memory foam, and the headphones fit snugly on your head. They also sound pretty good for their price, offering slightly improved audio quality from the originals, thanks to what appear to be upgraded drivers (also, they now support the LDAC audio codec for Android devices). You get a bit more clarity and a slightly better bass definition. Their sound didn't necessarily blow me away -- they lack a bit of openness -- but it's very good for what the headphones cost. Like their predecessor, they're pleasant-sounding headphones (even a bit more so now). \nOther features include an ambient mode that lets outside sound in and a low-latency gaming mode. The noise canceling has been upgraded slightly, and they're decent for voice calling. Battery life is pretty impressive, with up to 49 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels (and noise canceling off). \nA couple of things are still missing: There's no carrying case or headphone jack, although it can connect them to your computer with the included USB-C to USB-A cable. The 820NB Plus headphones are still a good value.\n \n    SCORE\n  \nApple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. They offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro -- Apple's $3,499 wearable headset. Is it possible that new acoustic architecture makes the buds sound subtly different from current devices like the iPhone? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available. \n \n    SCORE\n  \nSennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern, and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors.\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, though the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, as well as the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that \""assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste.\"" \nEquipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers \""best-in-class\"" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.\n \n    SCORE\n  \nIf you're able to get a tight seal with one of the three sizes of included ear tips, there's little to complain about with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro (read our full review). Yes, the noise-canceling might be a touch better, but the earbuds' excellent sound quality is clearly a step up from that of the Buds 2 Pro. Plus, they have a robust feature set, and their voice-calling performance is truly top-notch.\n \n    SCORE\n  \nWhen Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a new, slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations and that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). The QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling, and strong voice-calling performance.  \nAs for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products \""visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language.\"" It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to \""help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing.\"" There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com. \nWhile the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than over the year -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can read our review of the QuietComfort 45 to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones.\nYes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max delivers richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. They're heavy, but they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, although I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions.\nIn 2023, Sennheiser released a new midrange noise-canceling headphone called the Accentum that was sort of a slightly stripped-down version of its flagship Momentum Wireless 4 headphones with smaller 37mm drivers (the MW4 has 42mm drivers). The Accentum Plus, new for 2024, adds some extra features for $50 more, or $230. They include touch controls, adaptive noise canceling, support for the AptX Adaptive Audio codec, an analog port for wired listening and a hard carrying case. Although it costs more, I do recommend this model over the Accentum because of those extras.\nWhen I first tried them, they clamped down on my head a little too snugly. But after I worked them in and stretched out the headband a bit, they fit comfortably. They're an all-around strong performer, with good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance along with excellent sound quality that offers good clarity and well-defined bass (I also appreciated that they have USB-C audio so you can connect them to a computer or USB-C enabled smartphone with a USB-C cable and listen to audio). Like the flagship MW4s, which do offer slightly better sound quality, they're a bit generic looking. Still, they're very solid midrange headphones that are an even more appealing option when they get discounted to less than $200.\nHot on the heels of the third-generation AirPods, Apple has another new set of earbuds, this time from its subsidiary audio company, Beats. Technically, the 2021 Beats Fit Pro ($200) aren't AirPods, but they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro. Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio, Adaptive EQ and IPX4 water-resistance (splash-proof). I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. For some people, they might just be better than the AirPods Pro. Read our Beats Fit Pro review.\nBowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version. Now it's put out a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e with the \""e\"" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been returned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip.\nThese headphones are more comfortable than the original PX7s -- they tip the scales at 307 grams -- and not only sound better but have better noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with improved noise reduction. I don't necessarily think they're a better option than the lighter and even more comfortable Sony WH-1000XM5 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. The PX7 S2e certainly looks and feels luxurious, with its sturdy design, and delivers excellent sound. Bowers & Wilkins also sell a step-up model, the PX8, that features even better sound but costs significantly more.\nWhen they were originally announced, Bowers & Wilkins swanky PX8 noise-canceling headphones were supposed to cost $549 or essentially the same price as Apple's AirPod Max headphones. When they finally hit stores, the PX8's price jumped to $699 or a full $300 more than the company's step-down PX7 S2 headphones, which are also excellent (see below).\nThe biggest difference between the PX8, which weigh in at 320 grams, and the PX7 S2 are the PX8's all-new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are \""inspired\"" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's 700 Series loudspeaker line. Bowers & Wilkins says these units help deliver superior resolution, detail and timing with even more accurate sound than the PX7 S2.\nBased on my tests, that's true. While I liked the PX7 S2, the PX8 headphones do sound more special, with a touch more openness and overall clarity. They're right near the top for sound quality in Bluetooth headphones and are also comfortable to wear for long listening sessions (there's no listening fatigue with these guys). For the best sound, you can listen to lossless files on a computer in wired mode with a USB-C to USB-C cable. \nAs for the noise-canceling function, it's good but not quite on par with what you get from Sony's WH-1000XM5. And while the voice-calling capabilities are solid, these don't reduce background noise quite as well as some headphones like the Sony when you're on calls (the transparency mode is top-notch). \nWhile I can't say they're worth $300 more than the PX7 S2, they're a great set of cans if you can afford them. I do prefer the sound and overall performance of the more expensive Focal Bathys, although the Bathys don't have such strong noise canceling, but the PX8 headphones are a close second.  \nFrench audio company Focal is known for its high-end speakers and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. Now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. \nOver three years in development, the Bathys cost $699 and feature not only wireless connectivity but a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) for USB-wired listening with any computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C. They are easily one of the best-sounding wireless headphones.\nWe were fans of Beyerdynamic's earlier DT 770 Pro headphones. The new DT 700 X is easier to drive than the 770 Pro, thanks to the company's new STELLAR.45 sound transducer with an impedance of 48 ohms, so it plays better with smartphones, tablets and laptops without requiring a headphone amp.\nThe headphone is targeted at content creators who want accurate audio reproduction, but it's a bit more dynamic sounding and less bass-shy than many studio headphones, which tend to restrain the bass and hew toward a very neutral sound profile. The DT 700 X is a revealing, clean-sounding headphone that offers invitingly open sound (particularly for a closed-back headphone) and makes you realize what you're missing after listening to similarly priced Bluetooth headphones. \nUnlike the earlier DT 770 Pro, which is being sold at a nice discount (around $160), the DT 700 X comes with two interchangeable (detachable) straight cables in different lengths, and the DT 700 X arguably has a cleaner look than its predecessor.\nThe solidly built headphone -- it weighs 350 grams -- is quite comfortable, featuring upgraded soft, velour-covered memory foam earpads that offer decent passive noise isolation. The earpads and the headphones' other parts are replaceable, Beyerdynamic says. \nBeyerdynamic also sells the open-back DT 900 X for the same price. That model should provide slightly more open, airy sound but the big drawback is people around you can hear whatever you're listening to -- and sound also leaks in. This closed-back version is more versatile.\nIf you're willing to spend a lot of money, Beyerdynamic's 2nd-generation Xelento Wireless earbuds deliver fantastic sound quality. Note that these can be used wired or wireless, with the buds detaching from the Bluetooth 5.2 neckband so you can use them with the included traditional 3.5mm jack cable (included). \nEquipped with Berydynamic's 11mm Tesla.11 drivers, the Xelento Wireless earbuds are special because of how clean and clear they sound, with no distortion and tight, well-defined bass that has excellent extension. They're very accurate sounding. What's also nice is that the earbuds come with 10 ear tips of varying sizes, as well as a mix of silicone and foam tips (I was able to get a tight seal with the 3XL size ear tips). \nThe neckband has a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and amplifier courtesy of AKM, and there's support for Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android and other devices that support it (the LHDC codec is also supported). Like some other high-end earbuds, these feature an ear-monitor design similar to what musicians use, with the cable wrapping around the top of your ear. \nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new headphones. The quality of value-priced headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more -- sometimes much more. \nIt's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear throughout the day with minimal breaks.\nYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality.\nYou want the best-sounding headphones with the best noise-canceling, call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend.\nIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one.\nWe test headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.  \nMark Levinson No. 5909: The No. 5909 are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones and, yes, they're really expensive at $999. They're also really good. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy), and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headbands. Read our Mark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on.\nTechnics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800 -- and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback but the headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic sound with powerful bass and good detail (they take a day or two to break in). \nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3: Featuring excellent sound, improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well a smaller, more refined design that includes stabilizing fins (so the earbuds stay in your ears more securely), the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 are among the best true-wireless earbuds, giving the Sony WF-1000XM4 a run for the money. Read our Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 review.\nSennheiser 450BT: Sennheiser updated its well-regarded 4.50BTNC noise-canceling headphones in 2020. The new headphone model is called the 450BT, and it has some notable upgrades, including better battery life (up to 30 hours with noise canceling on), USB-C charging, Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX support for devices like the Samsung Galaxy smartphones that support it and more comfortable earpads. The 450BT noise-canceling headphones list for $200, but usually cost around $125 although they have dipped to as low as $100 in flash sales (they're a good value at that price).\nBoth companies make very good headphones, which offer excellent active noise canceling. Some people may argue that Sony has a very slight lead right now, but others may slightly prefer Bose. The Sony WH-1000XM5 is one of our top-rated headphones, but Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds 2 arguably have the best noise canceling at the moment. \nNeither is better or worse, they're just different styles of headphones. If you're looking for more discreet headphones, with a charging case that can easily fit in a pocket, true-wireless earbuds (in-ear headphones) are the way to go. Many people don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears, so they prefer full-size headphones. \nThey're getting close. Premium wireless headphones can easily sound better than middle-of-the-road wired headphones that cost less than $100. Going wired still is the best option for optimal sound quality, but wireless headphones often come with a cord that allows you to plug in.\nIf you're looking to muffle ambient sound from the outside world, active noise canceling is a feature you'll want in your headphones. Note that noise-canceling performance varies from headphone to headphone, with Bose, Sony and Apple arguably offering the best.  \n"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""system""}, {""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""\ncan you suggest best headphones/"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""human""}, {""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Here are the top 3 headphones across different styles and budgets:\n\n### 1. **Sony WH-1000XM4**\n- **Cost**: ~$200 USD (discounted)\n- **Reviews**: 4.7/5 (based on multiple sources)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Excellent noise cancellation\n  - Balanced sound with rich bass\n  - Comfortable for long periods\n  - Multipoint pairing and smart features (DSEE Extreme, 360 Reality Audio)\n- **Cons**:\n  - No water resistance\n  - Call quality could be better\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones**\n- **Cost**: ~$350 USD\n- **Reviews**: 4.8/5\n- **Pros**:\n  - Best-in-class noise cancellation\n  - Immersive audio with head tracking\n  - Comfortable for extended wear\n  - Great sound quality with deep bass and clear mids\n- **Cons**:\n  - Expensive\n  - Battery life (24 hours) is lower than some competitors\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Anker Soundcore Life Q30**\n- **Cost**: ~$80 USD\n- **Reviews**: 4.5/5\n- **Pros**:\n  - Affordable with solid ANC\n  - 44-hour battery life\n  - Customizable sound via app\n  - Comfortable and lightweight\n- **Cons**:\n  - Build quality feels less premium\n  - Bass can be overpowering at times\n\n---\n\nThese options cover a range of budgets and needs, from premium to budget-friendly."", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""ai""}, {""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""\nCan you tell me more about the Bose headphones?"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""human""}]","{""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Certainly! Here's a more detailed breakdown of the **Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones**:\n\n### **Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones**\n- **Cost**: ~$350 USD\n- **Reviews**: 4.8/5 (highly rated for noise cancellation and sound quality)\n\n### **Pros**:\n1. **Best-in-Class Noise Cancellation**: \n   - Bose is renowned for its noise-cancelling technology, and the QuietComfort Ultra takes it to the next level. It effectively blocks out a wide range of ambient noise, from low-frequency rumbles (like airplane engines) to higher-pitched sounds (like voices). Perfect for travel or noisy environments.\n   \n2. **Immersive Audio**:\n   - The **Immersive Audio** feature uses head-tracking technology to create a more spacious and dynamic soundstage.

The ear cups are plush and well-padded, and the overall design is lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for hours without discomfort.\n   \n4. **Great Sound Quality**:\n   - Bose has significantly improved the sound quality with these headphones. The sound is dynamic, with deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs, making them suitable for a wide range of music genres.\n   \n5. **Multipoint Connectivity**:\n   - You can connect the headphones to two devices simultaneously, allowing you to switch between, for example, your phone and laptop seamlessly.\n\n6. **App Features**:\n   - The **Bose Music App** allows you to customize the sound profile, adjust noise cancellation levels, and manage other smart features like voice assistants.\n\n### **Cons**:\n1. **Price**:\n   - At ~$350, these are premium headphones, which may be out of reach for some users. However, the quality and features justify the price for those seeking top-tier performance.\n   \n2. **Battery Life**:\n   - The battery life is **24 hours**, which is decent but lower compared to some competitors like the Sony WH-1000XM4 (30 hours) or Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 (60 hours). However, the fast charging feature provides 3 hours of playback from just a 15-minute charge.\n\n3. **No Hi-Res Audio Support**"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""ai""}"

If you’re looking for chic walking shoes for your summer wardrobe that are functional enough for logging thousands of steps, Chanel Perkins, DPM, a board-certified podiatrist, recommends you “look for durability and avoid flexibility.” Sandals with built-in arch support that don’t fold in half will be wisest, says Dr. Perkins. (Sorry, flimsy flip-flops—you’re best for lounging on the beach.) Although it may seem counterintuitive, you’re looking for “rigidity and firmness” throughout the bottom half of your kicks.\nBecause we’re just as obsessed with comfort as you are, our editors have tracked down the very best pairs (including plenty of sandals on Amazon) that actually hold up to hours of wear and check off all the boxes—style and support.

Its platform and excess of wide straps protect your feet from the elements of a long city walk. Wear the pair with baggy low-rise jeans or a flowy dress for a statement look that’s decidedly on trend.\nSave on the best walking sandals for women with these Nordstrom promo codes.\n\nAmazon\nZappos\nIf your day is shaping up to be too hot or wet for hiking boots, reach for Chacos instead.

The adjustable leather uppers come in a bunch of other colors too.\nSave on the best walking sandals for women with these Amazon promo codes.\n\nTeva\nAmazon\nThis Teva marries the brand’s aforementioned midform sandal and its strappier Voya Infinity sandal. The shoe has the classic Gladiator style, with straps that crisscross across the top of the foot to secure it to the sole, and grippy leather straps that wrap and tie daintily behind the ankle. The medium-height platform cushions the foot during long walks and adds height.\n\nNordstrom\nTory Burch\nTory Burch’s iconic Miller sandals are known for their soft Napa leather, lightly cushioned footbed, logo strap, and array of vibrant color offerings. Though they’re maybe not cloudlike enough for hours of walking, Glamour senior editor Jessica Radloff says they’re the pair she slides on for everyday wear and light strolls.\nSave on the best walking sandals for women with these Nordstrom promo codes.\n\nNordstrom\nZappos\nAnthropologie\nAn all-foam take on the brand’s classic Arizona style, this popular pick is perfect for vacationing. It’s waterproof, lightweight, and easy to stuff in a carry-on. There’s no ankle strap, but the brand’s signature insole literally molds to your feet over time, ensuring a secure fit. Just note that Birks are not for people with extra-narrow feet; these things give your dogs room to breathe.\n\nAncient Greek Sandals\nHow gorgeous are these Grecian sandals that lace around the ankle and up the calf?

One reason chips are so delicious has a lot to do with the crunch factor. Researchers have studied the intoxicating quality of potato chips and found that the notorious crunching sound has a big role in how much consumers like a food. The louder the noise, the more desirable the chip.\nWhile chips are also delicious, they tend to get a poor health reputation. Additionally, because they are most often fried, they are typically higher in trans fats, calories, and can contain a toxic substance called acrylamide. With that in mind, it's no wonder that brands with a greater focus on healthier snack options are booming in popularity. Whether your eating preferences are grain free, vegan, gluten free, or you just want to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet, check out this list of healthy chip brands, ranked from worst to best. Keep reading, and you might just find your new favorite snack.\n\n\nFans of ABC's \""Shark Tank\"" may be familiar with Jackson's (formerly known as Jackson's Honest). The founders, the Reamer Family, made the shift to a high fat, low carbohydrate diet in order to better the health of their son who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. As a result, the brand focuses on sweet potato chips made from higher quality oils like coconut and avocado, and flavors include from sea salt to Carolina BBQ.\nAs much as I appreciate the backstory for Jackson's Honest, the chips can fall short. Opinions on Amazon for the coconut oil sweet potato chips are mixed. And though reviews have improved over the years, the price is still a bit high, and the flavor not as satisfying as other brands. But for individuals with strict dietary preferences and those following elimination diets, don't completely discount Jackson's — just be careful about which flavor you pick. My favorite happens to be the avocado oil spicy tomatillo.\n\n\nTrue to its name, Good Health is the health-focused brand by Utz. The line of snacks includes familiar territory such as popcorn, veggie sticks, and pretzels with a focus on non-GMO ingredients and the use of different types of cooking oils. There are multiple kettle style potato chips to choose from with flavors such as avocado oil sea salt, olive oil sea salt, avocado oil barbecue, and avocado oil jalapeño.\nAccording to the Amazon reviews of the avocado oil barbecue flavor, people seem to like these chips. The general consensus is that they are not too greasy or salty and they taste great. My only complaint is that these are not nearly as healthy as some of the other brands on this list due to their high carbohydrate and high fat content (7 grams of fat and 17 grams of carbs per 1-ounce serving for the barbecue chips).\n\n\nSun Chips are wavy chips that are made with 100% whole grains, including corn, wheat, and whole oat flour, providing 48 grams of grains in every serving. They come in a variety of flavors, from Harvest Cheddar to Black Bean Spicy Jalapeño. Check out every Sun Chips flavor, from worst to best, before buying.\nAll varieties of Sun Chips contain 30% less fat than regular potato chips. These chips are made with traditional oils, like canola and sunflower, but the site doesn't say if they are baked or fried. They are free of artificial flavors, but they are made with sugar, salt, and sunflower or canola oil.\nAmazon reviewers enjoyed these snacks for snacking as is, or eating them with a dip, citing the crunch as the reason they liked them. Many were especially fond of the Harvest Cheddar variety, but there were also several fans of Garden Salsa, which one reviewer claimed had a little kick to it. Sun Chips are widely available and affordable, especially when purchased in bulk. They're not the healthiest option on this list, but for those who need to increase their whole grain intake, they're worth a look.\n\n\nIf you're looking to stock your pantry with strictly plant-based products, consider Brad's. Among the brand's multiple snack options is a line of chips made with air dried organic vegetables that includes flavors such as broccoli cheddar, red bell pepper, and Vampire Killer. Are you as intrigued as I am by that last one? Well, it happens to be a lemony kale chip made with cashew cheese, and, not surprisingly, lots of garlic.  \nThe brand, however, has its detractors, with complaints on Amazon ranging from an unpleasant aroma from the chips to quality inconsistency from bag to bag. One reviewer mentions love for these chips, but notes that you must eat them with dip for the best taste. Though I prefer a chip that stands on its own, these are a solid bet for vegans in search of a low calorie, low fat and high protein snack.  \n\n\nBare specializes in baked chips made from freeze dried fruits. These sweet treats are available in familiar fruit varieties, including apple, banana, coconut, strawberry, and pineapple. While these are not your typical chips, Amazon reviews of the pineapple & coconut variety show indicate many people find them as a great replacement for standard potato crisps. However, there are some complaints of being overpriced and containing added sugar, though many note that these chips are kid-approved, which is a major plus. I know how hard it can be to get kids to eat fruits, and an item like this may ease their reluctance — in which gets case you can justify the high cost.\nThe Bare product line may come in handy for certain snacking situations, but it fails to offer the salty goodness that we  generally look for when I'm craving chips. For that reason, I've placed these towards the bottom of the ranking.\n\n\nAir popped chips made from ingredients like mushrooms, yuca, and onions is the name of the game for Snacklins. Because these plant crisps are so airy, they are very low in calories — a mere 90 per 0.9-ounce bag. Snacklins offers a variety of flavors ranging from the familiar bbq and nacho to teriyaki and cinnamon churro. One thing I appreciate about Snacklins is that I've never had any chips like these, and I appreciate the root vegetable swap from potato to yuca (sometimes referred to as cassava), which is used quite frequently in grain free products because of its high starch content.\nUnfortunately, according to the Amazon reviews of the Snacklins variety pack, there are some mixed opinions of these chips. While some people love that these chips are tasty options that fit into their diet plans like WW or keto, others complain about a recent product recipe change that resulted in an inferior product. \n\n\nSiete Foods is a Mexican-American brand devoted to making grain free food products that range from cookies to sauces. When it comes to chips, there are several bags to choose from including multiple kettle cooked potato-based flavors, but the most options are of the tortilla variety.\nBecause the tortilla chips are made without grains (cassava serves as a substitute for the familiar corn base), I find that the texture is a bit too fragile. As a result, they don't have the best crunch, not to mention, I tend to find that the bag is filled with broken crumbs that aren't suitable for dipping. Still, the flavor delivers. According to the Amazon reviews of the dip chips, even those that are not interested in following a grain-free diet love these chips for their taste. While they are a bit pricey, many people note that these chips are super tasty.\n\n\nYou may have come across banana and plantain chips in your supermarket aisle, but Barnana takes the snack to a whole other level (it's no surprise that the founder is from Brazil). Over the past decade, the company has expanded its product line to include multiple sweet and savory banana-based treats including several flavors of chips that fall into either the kettle cooked or tortilla categories.\nPer the Amazon reviews of the Acapulco lime plantain chips, Barnana delivers on offering a desirable potato chip alternative. They not only taste delicious, but they are great for specialty diets including AIP and Whole 30. I happen to agree that these chips are fantastic. It all comes down to the strong texture of plantains, which offer the most epic crunch ever. As for our favorite flavors, I prefer the sea salt & vinegar and the spicy mango salsa which delivers some welcome sweet heat. If you haven't tried these banana chips yet, what are you waiting for?\n\n\nPopChips sell a variety of chips that are never fried, but instead placed in a high pressure environment forcing them to pop. I love that these are made from potatoes, instead of corn, ensuring that they taste more like a traditional chip, at least compared to some of the other healthy chip options. PopChips offers a deep flavor roster with varieties including barbeque, aged white cheddar, sour cream & onion, sea salt & vinegar, and Crazy Hot. If you prefer your chips with ridges, the brand also offers those too.\nWhile I heartily endorse PopChips, make sure you try them with the right expectations. They are not fried chips, so the crunch and flavor factor won't be comparable. But that difference is made up for by the fact that, on average, a 1-ounce serving of these is 4 grams of fat and 120 calories compared to 10 grams of fat and 160 calories for a standard fried potato chip. For my money, PopChips is among the best chip brands, healthy or otherwise.\n\n\nLate July offers a wide range of organic and non-GMO snacks. While the brand includes a line of potato chips, tortilla chips reign supreme and flavor choices include the standard sea salt as well more interesting options such as Mexican Street Corn and Garden Ranch. My personal favorite is the restaurant style sea salt and lime tortilla chips which offers a welcome citrus kick.\nI'm also a fan of the chia & quinoa tortilla chips. I find that these have just a hint of flavor that I look for in tortilla chips — plus they taste amazing with salsa and guacamole. It's also nice knowing we can increase our intake of healthy omega 3 fatty acids with the addition of the chia seeds. In fact, Late July produces several multigrain chips that include chia seeds from your basic blue corn to sweet potato and the cheesy citrus Mild Green Mojo. Considering the variety of chips and tasty flavors, this is a brand that delivers.\n\n\nBecause these aren't fried (they happen to be yellow corn chips that have been popped, via high pressure), PopCorners contain less sodium and about half the fat content of typical potato chips. Beyond including non-GMO ingredients, most flavors are actually gluten free, which is amazing for those with Celiac's.\nPopCorners may not offer a lot of variety, but the limited flavors tend to be great. My suggestion for the first timers: Opt for a variety pack, which includes a range of options such as white cheddar, sweet chili, spicy queso. These chips are the essentially perfect cross between tortillas and popcorn. Beyond the delicious taste, also have an ideal texture somewhere in the sweet spot of pillowy soft and crispy crunchy. While I enjoy the more adventurous flavors like sweet and salty kettle corn, keep in mind that the basic sea salt only contains three ingredients, which I definitely appreciate.\n\n\nBeanitos makes chips from beans. Yep, you read that right. Why would anybody do such a thing? Well, beans have a high amount of plant-based protein and fiber in addition to their starchy content, making them a great nutrition-packed alternative to making chips with potatoes.\nThis Austin, Texas brand, which was founded in 2010, sources it beans from American farmers and cook them low and slow, to create a bean masa that serves as the base for the tortilla-style chips. Beanitos are made from white beans, pinto beans, and black beans, and flavors include sea salt, sweet chili & sour cream, and chipotle bbq. Each option packs an impressive 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber per serving. For snack foods fans looking to add fiber and protein to their diet plan, but don't want to sacrifice on flavor and crunch, make these chips a priority.\n\n\nIf you visit the Hippeas website, you'll be greeted by a plethora of certifications. Hippeas Organic Chickpea Puffs are vegan, Project Non-GMO Verified, certified Gluten-Free, allergy-friendly, and sustainably farmed. Hippeas also claims that the peas they use are sustainably grown. All of the brand's snack foods are made from chickpea flour and contain 2 grams of fiber and 3 or 4 grams of protein per serving, ¼ of the bag — which is fairly generous.\nHippeas are a good option for anyone looking for a vegan, allergen-free alternative to standard cheese puffs. They come in four varieties: Vegan White Cheddar, Nacho Vibes, Bohemian Barbecue, and Sriracha Sunshine. Reviewers on Amazon enjoyed the portion size and loved the crunch and flavor.\nHippeas also makes tortilla chips, available in Sea Salt & Lime, Rockin' Ranch, and Nacho Vibes, and veggie straws in three flavors. The nacho flavor in both varieties is a good imitation of those unhealthy nacho chips that use non-GMO corn. I think they could even earn a spot in a top tortilla chip rankings. Note that the tortilla chips are fried while the puffs are baked, so choose your options carefully. They are a bit more costly than typical chips, however, you can buy them in bulk online. Hippeas Puffs' appeal to vegans and people with food allergies makes them worth the investment.\n\n\nFood Should Taste Good was founded in 2006 by Pete Lascoe, who was inspired to create a snack brand that sourced high quality and wholesome ingredients. The brand is also devoted to the transparency of sourcing ingredients and non-GMO products, as well as supporting positive farming practices that make the soil healthier.\nThese tortilla chips are essentially divided into two categories: plain and flavored. To be clear, plain doesn't equate to boring. Far from it. Beyond the familiar blue corn, Food Should Taste Good also offers multigrain, sweet potato, and black bean chips, all of which are well-suited for dipping. But for straight snacking, you won't get enough of the flavored chips. The pre-loaded guacamole chips include actual avocados in the seasoning, while the cheddar is made with real cheese. For some heat, the spicy jalapeño will do the trick, and for something a little tangy, we recommended the Korean-inspired kimchi flavor.\n\n\nIt shouldn't be much of a surprise what the main ingredient is in the tortilla chips that come from Beanfields. Since these chips are made from beans, they contain more fiber and plant based protein than normal potato chips. Whether you opt for spicy queso, pico de gallo, or salt and vinegar, chips, you can expect 4 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber per serving.\nI've noticed that the sour cream & onion flavor is one that is often lacking in the healthy chip category, so I am thrilled that Beanfields offers that option. Speaking of all-time great chip flavors, the brand's nacho is an ideal alterative to Doritos. Reviewers on Amazon mention that they are fairly crunchy and hold up well with dips, which is a good factor to consider when choosing any chips. People also love that Beanfields are healthier than the competition, but taste just like corn tortilla chips.\n\n\nYou've likely heard of Terra chips. You know the ones made from all sorts of veggies? The brand has been making chips from real whole vegetables since 1990 and does an incredible job sourcing other root vegetables beside the classic potato, including especially nutritious picks, like beets, turnips, sweet potatoes, and carrots.\nWhile I appreciate all the different Terra products throughout the years, the Original real vegetable chips (a blend of parsnip, taro, sweet potato, yuca, and batata) remain a must-eat snack. They offer the perfect amount of crunch and salt, with just a touch of sweetness. But the gold standard vegetable chip has some competition from the Blues potato chips, which skews more towards purple, but regardless, they definitely won't leave you sad. With over three decades of experience producing high quality chips, it is no wonder why Terra is at the top of this ranking.\n\n\nThe chips on this list were selected for their choice of healthier ingredients over traditional chips, which often contain ingredients that are high in fat, calories, and other undesirable options. We also choose chips that were air-dried, air-fried, and baked when possible, over chips that were fried. We relied on online reviews for quality and taste.\nWe prioritized chips made with better quality oils, such as avocado, coconut, or olive. We also selected items made from ingredients that were more nutritious than corn or potatoes, such as root vegetables, beans, chia, quinoa, multigrain, and mushrooms. Organic and non-GMO chips were prioritized. Ranking was also influenced by whether a chip was gluten-free, vegan, or grain-free. Finally, we looked at the nutrient value of the chip. High-fat, low-carb, low-calorie chips ranked higher, as did those that were high in fiber and/or protein.\nChips were ranked according to how nutritious the ingredients were and the quality of the chip. For chip quality, we looked for crunchiness — the crunchier, the better. We also determined how well chips made for dipping held up in dips. A variety of options for flavored chips was also a consideration. Finally, we determined if the serving size was reasonably low in fat or calories and whether it was satisfying."", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""system""}, {""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""\nrecommend a healthy brand of chips"", ""additional_kwargs"": {}}, ""type"": ""human""}]","{""data"": {""name"": """", ""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Here are the top 3 healthy chip brands:\n\n1. **Terra Chips**\n   - **Cost**: Approximately $3.99 for a 5-ounce bag.\n   - **Reviews**: Generally positive, praised for their unique flavors and crunch.\n   - **Pros**: Made from a variety of root vegetables, offering a nutritious alternative to traditional chips.

But, like all velvet flocked hangers, they can shed.\nThese hangers are just as great as our other budget pick, except they don’t have a notch for straps, and they come only in packs of 100.\nThese German, PVC-coated, nonslip steel hangers are expensive, but they’re well built and beautifully designed, and they come in several shapes and colors.\nMay be out of stock\nWe looked for hangers that fit a variety of garments.\nWe prioritized shapes and materials that kept clothes (especially light-weight ones) from sliding off of hangers.\nTiered designs can extend a closet’s capacity, and thinner hangers allow more items to fit on a rod.\nWe kept an eye out for splinters or cracks in wooden hangers, breakage in plastic hangers, and abnormal shedding in velvet ones.\nThese hangers are lightweight, well constructed, and affordably priced for wood. But you can’t get fewer than 50 at a time.\nLightweight and slim, the Proman Kascade KSA9030 Hangers are classic and versatile. They have metal loops, allowing you to chain-link the hangers vertically. And the smooth finish and sturdy construction set these hangers apart from similarly priced models we tested.\nThe Proman hangers are strong enough to hold heavy winter coats (and even suits) while also accommodating pieces with delicate straps. They’re sold only in packs of 50, but once you start using them, you may find you want even more to replace any subpar hangers you may have.\nAdvertisement\nAvailable in different quantities and colors, these space-saving, ultra-slim flocked hangers keep garments in place and don’t cost much. But, like all velvet flocked hangers, they can shed.\nThese hangers are just as great as our other budget pick, except they don’t have a notch for straps, and they come only in packs of 100.\nVelvet flocked hangers are great due to their slim, space-saving size and the secure grip that prevents clothes from slipping. The Amazon Basics Slim Velvet Hangers offer the best combination of quality and price, and they come in several quantities and colors.\nCostco’s Flocked Hangers work identically to our pick from Amazon Basics, but the Costco hangers don’t have a notch for straps, and they come only in black. They are cheaper than the Amazon Basics hangers, but you can buy them only in packs of 100 (and you need a Costco membership to do so).\nEven though the Amazon Basics and Costco hangers both shed less than others we tested, they do still shed, and they can snap if they’re yanked too hard from a curtain rod.\nThese German, PVC-coated, nonslip steel hangers are expensive, but they’re well built and beautifully designed, and they come in several shapes and colors.\nMay be out of stock\nMawa’s Space-Saving Hangers are ultra-slim and nonslip, with an elegant steel-rod design that will help them last for years (10 of those covered by warranty). Their rubbery PVC coating (available in several colors) keeps even the slinkiest clothes from falling to the floor.\nUnlike our other picks, these hangers come in two shapes: the Euro (with a downturned-arc shape, to prevent dents in delicate knits) and the Silhouette (which offers the more-common shoulder-shaped profile). Their only flaw: They’re expensive.\nAdvertisement\nDorie Chevlen is a staff writer at Wirecutter covering all things home and decor. She has spent her entire adult life trying to properly store her clothes in rental apartments with too-small closets. Gregory Han is a longtime Wirecutter contributor and former managing editor at Apartment Therapy. He’s advised countless readers about storage and decluttering strategies, and he once shared a studio apartment and small single closet with his wife.\nFor this guide, we did the following:\nThe best hanger should store and maintain garments without stretching, creasing, tearing, or changing the original shape of your clothing. Hangers come in a dizzying multitude of shapes, sizes, and garment-specific designs. We focused mainly on general-use and space-saving hangers, but you can also find some pant, skirt, and suit hangers we tested in our other good hangers section. Here are some of the criteria we considered:\nA fit-all approach: We looked for hangers that would suit most garments. According to Sean Crowley of Crowley Vintage: “It’s swell if you can have a dozen hyper-specific hangers for specific garments, but it works just as well if you find a single hanger that can serve 99% of your wardrobe.”\nNonslip features and materials: We looked for shapes, materials, and features that kept garments from sliding off hangers. Professional organizer Beth Penn recommends wooden hangers with metal hooks—which last longer than their plastic equivalents—and strap notches (like our top pick).\nSpace-saving features: Hangers with swivel necks offer easier organization in a small closet; tiered-hanging features can also extend a closet’s capacity but can complicate access, too.\nDurability: We looked for hangers that would last for years, without any material degradation or breaking. For flocked hangers (the ones textured to feel like velvet), we kept an eye out for any that broke easily or shed excessively. All flocked hangers will shed somewhat, but we eliminated any that shed too much.\nAfter researching more than 40 different hangers, from both big-box and specialty online retailers, we chose 20 of the highest-rated models for weeks of hands-on testing.\nWe pulled pant bars and hooks with reasonable (and unreasonable) force to assess sturdiness, and we carefully inspected each hanger for sharp edges, exposed hardware, and any wonky construction. We hung clothes on all of the hangers, and we took them on and off closet rods dozens of times, over weeks of testing.\nWe tested clamps on fabric (and on the meatiest part of our palms) to see how strong they were and whether they left indentations on clothing. We twisted the hooks around and around to make sure they wouldn’t snap off; we weighed them down with heavy coats to assess their strength; and we rubbed velvet hangers between cotton to see how much their flocking shed. And, of course, we also used them in our daily lives, to get a sense of real-world experience.\nAdvertisement\nThese hangers are lightweight, well constructed, and affordably priced for wood. But you can’t get fewer than 50 at a time.\nOur favorite all-purpose wooden hangers, the Proman Kascade KSA9030 Hangers, have been a pick for nearly a decade, thanks to their durable construction and versatile shape. These hangers are also sold on Wayfair under the label Rebrilliant.\nThey handle different garment types (and many at once). The Proman Kascade hangers are sturdy enough to support heavy coats and pants, but they also have shoulder notches for slim-strapped dresses or tops. The smooth wooden finish and rounded hook ends prevent snagging, making these hangers well suited for a large range of clothing and fabric types. The swivel hook on each has a built-in loop for space-saving tiered hanging, so you can connect several hangers in a row.\nThey’re made to last for years. The Proman Kascade hangers have been a pick since 2016. In that time, we’ve heard almost no complaints from readers and staff. One staff member uses them to hang wet clothes to air-dry, and even they haven’t experienced wood warping or any finish peeling. Compared with other wooden hangers, the Kascade’s pant bar flexed less when we pulled on it.\nYou may never need another hanger again. At around $1.90 per hanger, the Proman Kascade is definitely not the cheapest wooden hanger, but it’s cheaper than other similar quality hangers. It’s a great value considering you may never need to buy hangers again.\nAvailable in different quantities and colors, these space-saving, ultra-slim flocked hangers keep garments in place and don’t cost much. But, like all velvet flocked hangers, they can shed.\nThese hangers are just as great as our other budget pick, except they don’t have a notch for straps, and they come only in packs of 100.\nThe Amazon Basics Slim Velvet Hangers offer the best combination of price and quality for a space-saving, nonslip hanger. Costco’s Flocked Hangers are equally great, except they don’t have a notch for straps, and they come only in packs of 100.\nThey’re well constructed. The swivel hooks on the Amazon Basics hangers are securely attached and smoothly finished (which means no snagged clothing). All of the flocked hangers we tested shed somewhat in our rub tests, but the Amazon Basics and Costco hangers were the least guilty of this.\nThe Amazon Basics hangers come in several colors. The Amazon Basics hangers come in six different flocking colors (and three swivel-hook finishes), which is more than for any hanger we tested. If you’re concerned about the velvet finish rubbing off on any clothes, it’s helpful to pick flocking that’s closer in color to the clothes you’re worried about; that way if the flocking does shed, it should at least blend in. (The Costco hanger comes only in black).\nAnd there’s an equally great flocked hanger from Costco. Costco’s Flocked Hangers are just as good as the Amazon Basics hangers, so we recommend getting either, from whichever retailer you prefer shopping at. They don’t have a notch for straps, but we found this feature less important because of how grippy they already are. They’re available only in black and come in large packs of 100. But since they’re about 35¢ per hanger, they’re the best value of any of the flocked hangers we tested.\nAdvertisement\nThese German, PVC-coated, nonslip steel hangers are expensive, but they’re well built and beautifully designed, and they come in several shapes and colors.\nMay be out of stock\nThe steel and rubber-coated Mawa Space-Saving Hangers are ultra-slim and impeccably made, and they keep slippery clothes from falling off.\nThey are grippy and durable. The Mawa hangers have a streamlined steel-rod design and grippy PVC-coating that lasts for years. Our tester has been using the Euro and pant hangers since 2018 and has seen no sign of wear or sticky residue on the coating. And, unlike what we’ve seen with some other slim hangers, with these we haven’t seen any excessive creasing on any clothing.\nThey make closet organization easy. Despite their very narrow build, these hangers do have a hook that swivels, for easy closet organization. And if you’re really tight on space, Mawa sells connectors to link hangers together for tiered “waterfall” hanging.\nThey come in multiple styles. The Mawa hanger is available in a variety of styles, including the Euro (whose downturned-arc shape prevents shoulder denting in knit fabrics), the Silhouette (which has the better-known shoulder-shaped profile), a pant hanger, and a hanger for draping scarves, belts, or ties. Both the Euro and Silhouette hangers come with or without the pant bar.\nIf you care about reducing creases in your best pants, skirts, and suits, consider investing in clothing-specific hangers. Here are some of the best ones we tested:\nFor hanging pants: After testing nine other pant hangers with pants of nearly every weight and fabric, we think the space-saving Mawa KH1 Pant Hangers are ideal. The PVC nonslip coating has just the right amount of grip to hold a variety of fabrics securely in place, sans end hook. Yet pants still easily came off without “sticking,” compared with the performance of other rubber-coated models.\nFor hanging skirts: Of the three models we tested, the Mawa K30D Clip Hanger impressed us the most, thanks to its narrow nonslip clips and build quality. Mawa’s clips feel secure, and they also take up slightly less physical space than those of the competition.\nFor hanging suits: The Kirby Allison Luxury Wooden Suit Hanger hits the highest mark for construction, materials, and detailing, making it our favorite suit hanger. For perfect alignment within your suit size, there are four different widths, each featuring a sloped shoulder flare that mimics the body, to better maintain garment form. However, these hangers are big and heavy (each one takes up about the same width as five Proman Kascade hangers aligned side by side). And they are considerably expensive, at over $30 for a single hanger. Kirby Allison offers a 30-day return policy and a one-year warranty.\nFor a touch of whimsy: If you have an exposed closet or garment rack, and you want to add some color to your closet, we love the neon-hued, translucent acrylic Staff Hangers. Each hanger is super sturdy, with a smooth ball-end hook and nonslip notches, and there’s a smiley face where the hook meets. Though these hangers are pricier than our other picks, we suspect they’ll make you smile too.\nAdvertisement\nOur home editor has been using IKEA Bumerang hangers since late 2017—for everything from winter coats to blazers to silk shirts—with neither an issue nor a complaint. But in comparison with our top all-purpose pick, price reflects quality. In our testing, we found a rough wooden finish, inconsistent construction, and a weakly secured pant bar to be common.\nKirby Allison’s very expensive Women’s Blouse & Sweater Hanger with Clips (Profile B1) is designed with a smaller shoulder width and a sharper arm angle. The 1.15-inch shoulder flare is flocked at the ends, and the notches are covered in felt flocking to further prevent slipping. This hanger also has clips for skirts with ribbed rubber clamps. This is a beautiful fine-garment hanger for delicate blouses, but at $22 each (at the time of publication), the Profile B1 is not worth it for most people.\nWe previously recommended the Container Store Basic Natural Wood Hangers, but they have been discontinued.\nThe Container Store’s Non-Slip Velvet Hangers performed just as well as our pick from Amazon Basics, and we like that you can buy them in smaller quantities (a case of 10). They also come in two design options: shirt (with no pant bar) or suit (with pant bar). But they’re a little more expensive and harder to find in stock. We also noticed that shortly after we purchased ours, the reviews have gotten significantly worse.\nThe Tosnail Super Grippy Slip-Reducing Contour Shirt Hangers look like a knockoff of the Mawa hangers. But some reviewers complained that the rubber coating was too sticky, and others said this hanger was too large for small tops.\nTarget’s Brightroom Flocked Hangers shed worse than any other flocked hangers we tested, leaving black residue on cotton with very little pressure applied. We rejected these immediately.\nWe were hopeful that the Hangers.com Flocked Wood Top Hanger W/ Notches could be the Goldilocks of hangers: the sturdiness of wood with the grippines of velvet. The wooden part feels sturdy enough, but the hook looks unfinished, feels loose, and has sharp edges that can catch. The stem of the hook is also very short. And these hangers are about seven times more expensive than our Amazon Basics pick.\nWe previously recommended the Joy Mangano Huggable Hangers, but they’ve been discontinued.\nThe Container Store Chrome Metal Pant Hangers used to be our pant hanger pick, but they’ve been discontinued. If you can still find them in-store, they’re an excellent choice.\nThe JS Hanger Slacks Pant Hangers’ biggest drawback is the sticky rubber coating on the pant bar. In our testing it was a dust magnet that transferred lint onto darker fabrics. And we had to remove the hanger from the rod to retrieve our pants, defeating the convenience of an open-end design.\nWe liked the felt-lined trouser grip of Kirby Allison’s Luxury Wooden Clamping Trouser Hanger, which is designed for storing pants upside down from the cuff, reducing the formation of wrinkles. But it’s expensive and really only useful for dress slacks.\nThe reinforced and solid construction of the Butler Luxury Trouser Hanger is nice, but it’s almost double the normal width. They’re less expensive than the Kirby Allison trouser hanger, but the opening for slotting pants in is a bit too narrow.\nThe Whitmor Ebony Chrome Add-On Skirt/Slack Hanger has a tier hook that protrudes, causing dimples in skirts.\nThe Butler Luxury Tailor Made Suit Hanger has noticeably less-rounded and rougher finished ends in comparison with Kirby Allison’s Suit Hangers. It’s big and bulky, and only a few would fit in our closet.\nThe Container Store Superior Natural Wooden Coat and Suit Hanger is available only in 18-inch models, for suit sizes 43 to 48. We dismissed it because of its inflexibility in sizing, but if 43 to 48 is your size, and you need a more budget-friendly suit hanger, this would be a good option.\nThe Wooden Hangers USA 18″ Ultimate Wide Suit Hanger is designed to hold extra-large suits, but our hanger’s pant bar had visible gaps and rough edges.\nOriginal reporting by Alex Arpaia and Katie Okamoto.

If you’re looking for chic walking shoes for your summer wardrobe that are functional enough for logging thousands of steps, Chanel Perkins, DPM, a board-certified podiatrist, recommends you “look for durability and avoid flexibility.” Sandals with built-in arch support that don’t fold in half will be wisest, says Dr. Perkins. (Sorry, flimsy flip-flops—you’re best for lounging on the beach.) Although it may seem counterintuitive, you’re looking for “rigidity and firmness” throughout the bottom half of your kicks.\nBecause we’re just as obsessed with comfort as you are, our editors have tracked down the very best pairs (including plenty of sandals on Amazon) that actually hold up to hours of wear and check off all the boxes—style and support.

The higher percentage of cacao in dark chocolate is the secret to so many of our favorite chocolate desserts, like these simple dark chocolate vanilla cookies or this classic molten chocolate cake.\n\n But let’s be real: You don’t always feel like breaking out the baking tools and cookie sheets when you’re craving a chocolate fix. Sometimes, a bar of the best dark chocolate is all you need to hit the spot. With so many options, finding truly high-quality chocolate can be quite tricky. That’s why we recently taste-tested 15 of the best dark chocolate bars. We also chatted with a registered dietitian to get some additional expert insights.\n\n After blind-tasting dozens of popular dark chocolate brands, we found ten clear winners for snacking. These bars all contain 70% or more cacao, and happily, many of them don’t cost much more than a latté.\n\n At $10 per 3-ounce bar, this is certainly not the cheapest chocolate bar on our list. However, it was undeniably one of our favorites in our taste test. The cacao used in this bar is entirely from the Dominican Republic, and the result is chocolate with a strong sense of place (not to mention, an incredibly fragrant scent and brightly fruity, intensely floral flavor). There’s a pleasantly bitter finish that reminds us of citrus peel and pith.\n\n The Dos Rios bar has a clean snap and a smooth exterior, indicating a high quality of craftsmanship. The texture of the chocolate, as it melts, is stunningly smooth with no perceptible grittiness; it ranked 4.67 out of 5 on our smoothness scale. The ingredient list is impressive, too, with whole vanilla beans used to enhance the cacao. We feel this thoughtfully-made bar provides a luxurious sensory experience if you can swallow the cost.\n\n Bar size: 3 ounces | Allergens: May contain traces of peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, and milk products | Vegan: Not certified but is made with vegan-suitable ingredients\n\n Decidedly not a pick for the milk chocolate crowd, this deep, dark bar contains 85% cacao. It’s moderately dark in color; the coffee and mocha-hued tones combined with a glossy, low-shine coat make it an attractive, enticing bar. It ranked neatly in the middle on both our earthy and fruity scent scale, giving it a nicely balanced, crowd-pleasing profile.\n\n The snap is satisfyingly sharp, but the real reward comes to the patient connoisseur. The slow-to-melt texture starts as intensely bitter but reveals notes of rich roasted coffee and toast as it begins to warm and soften. There’s a moderate tongue-coating finish that’s refreshingly devoid of tannic bite. The price — around $4 per 3-ounce bar — is hard to beat, as is this brand’s ubiquity. It’s stocked in many natural grocers and markets.\n\n Bar size: 3 ounces | Allergens: May contain milk, wheat, almond, hazelnuts, coconut, and pecans | Vegan: Yes\n\n With a saturated, rich “true brown” hue and moderate gloss, this bar has a classic, inviting aesthetic. The scent was surprisingly subdued for an 80% bar; at least three of us described it as mellow (though in no way unpleasant; it was fun to uncover some subtle aromas more familiar with beer, like hops, malt, and yeast). There was an audible, almost aggressive snap without any dust or fine shards.\n\n It’s quite bitter — to be expected of a higher percentage of cacao — but during the taste portion of our test, we noted that came from a “cacao-forward” flavor profile, backed up with gentle floral notes. The K’UL bar, more than most we tested, became more pronounced in all its flavors as it melted, growing louder in both tannins and bitterness, but floral and fruit too. The finish is surprisingly short and doesn’t leave any film or stickiness in the mouth. Unlike most dark bars, this one contains no vanilla: just cacao, sugar, and cocoa butter.\n\n Bar size: 2.8 ounces | Allergens: Made in a facility that processes milk, eggs, almonds, coconut, or other tree nuts | Vegan: Not certified but is made with vegan-suitable ingredients\n\n K+M Chocolate is the result of a collaboration with Chef Thomas Keller and olive oil producer Armando Manni. The bar we tasted in this review contains an impressively high 85% cacao, which is sourced exclusively from Ecuador. It’s stunningly dark, velvety, and glossy; we noted it had a distinctly “luxurious” aesthetic immediately upon viewing. There’s a bark-like aroma that leans heavier toward the “earthy” end of the scale.\n\n The from-the-earth aromas followed through on the palate, calling to mind woods, campfire, and, again, pure cacao nibs. The texture is pure indulgence: A K+M bar is almost impossibly velvety with a full mouth-coating sensation that further reveals notes of lemon, tea, and bourbon. This is one of the most expensive bars we tasted and the packaging is highly attractive, making it one of the most giftable chocolate options on this list. It’s a bar for savoring, not inhaling, with one of the most unique flavor profiles we’ve tried.\n\n Bar size: 2.5 ounces | Allergens: Unspecified | Vegan: Not certified but is made with vegan-suitable ingredients\n\n Although many of the bars we tested are naturally vegan and gluten-free, Pascha’s 85% bar is one of the most food allergy-safe options you can buy. It’s certified free from the top eight allergens (including soy and tree nuts) and is made without emulsifiers. But equally important is the experience of, you know, eating it. Happily, that’s a five-star experience, too. This bar is a deep nut brown, falling somewhere between tawny and hickory on our color scale, and has a consistent gloss.\n\n Pascha’s 85% bar received a 3 out of 5 on both the earthy and fruity scale, solidifying its classification as a balanced, moderately aromatic bar that will likely please a wide variety of dark chocolate lovers. For this reason, it only makes sense that the bar sells out so often. It presents an initially strong nutty flavor that releases smoky, berry-forward flavors and an inviting smoothness as it melts. It’s one of the least expensive bars we tested, earning it a top spot on our list for any bar — not just an allergen-free one.\n\n Bar size: 2.82 ounces | Allergens: Completely free from the 8 major allergens and made in an allergen-free facility | Vegan: Yes, certified\n\n During our tests, we tasted Raaka’s Philippines 71% Classic Dark Bar, a cult-favorite chocolate bar so popular that it frequently sells out. However, this trio includes two dark chocolate bars that we think will satisfy any dark chocolate craving — the 71% Pink Sea Salt and even darker 85% Bourbon Cask Aged. Fans of Raaka appreciate the single-farm sourcing and unroasted cacao, which sets this brand apart from the pack.\n\n In our taste test, we found the aroma of the bar was well balanced with a hard-to-define tone many of us described as “classic” or “straight” chocolate. It broke cleanly and “without drama,” although we noted that the lack of preformed segments made it difficult to portion — however, we did feel it’d be great for chopping and using in a recipe. There were intriguing smoky notes upon first taste; campfires, coffee, and mezcal were all invoked. There’s a bracing astringency that lingers, with the raw cacao taking center stage long after the chocolate has been eaten. Although unroasted cacao can be polarizing, we think this is one of the most successful raw brands around.\n\n Bar size: 1.8 ounces | Allergens: Free from gluten, soy, tree nuts (except coconut), peanuts, and dairy | Vegan: Not certified but is made with vegan-suitable ingredients in a dairy-free facility\n\n Although Theo doesn’t crow about it on this bar’s packaging, the cacao is single origin, all sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The bar is a woodsy brown color with a slightly matte finish and is sectioned into big squares perfect for snacking. The aroma is mellow and mild, with subtle notes of black tea and nuts. It had one of the most deliciously satisfying snaps of all the bars we tested.\n\n The tannins and astringency of a good black tea are again present on the tongue, with almond undertones and a slightly chalky texture. With time, the intense flavors gave way to gentler fruity notes, and the texture softened and smoothed. Theo’s bar had a bold, unapologetic finish that many of us thought would shine in a bittersweet chocolate recipe, like flourless chocolate cake. Theo’s 85% bar is not for the faint of heart, and that’s exactly what many dark chocolate fans will appreciate about it. \n\n Bar size: 3 ounces | Allergens: Made on equipment that also processes milk, peanuts, and tree nuts | Vegan: Not certified but is made with vegan-suitable ingredients\n\n Another bar for the deep, dark crowd, this was an editor’s pick for a truly intense bar that doesn’t back down on the cacao-forward flavor. “Alter Eco bars have been my favorite for a few years now! The 85% is great, but I have no self-control with the 90%. I tell myself it doesn't count as candy,” says associate editor Mary Lagroue.\n\n Alter Eco’s Classic Blackout is a blend of Ecuadorian and Dominican cacao that’s married by Swiss chocolatiers (how’s that for international influence?) The result is a well-balanced, bitter bar that’s malty and fruity in equal parts. The 85% bar is part of Alter Eco’s “Blackout” collection, which includes raspberry, orange, and almond blackouts — all made with 85% cacao — as well as a 90%, 90% mint, and breathtaking 100% bar.\n\n Bar size: 3 ounces | Allergens: Made on equipment shared with milk, hazelnuts, almonds, coconut, and soy | Vegan: Not certified but is made with vegan-suitable ingredients\n\n The Jcoco Prism Box is another editor favorite, tailor-made for gifting a chocolate lover. “I like Jcoco’s mix box which has both classic and other flavors,” says associate editorial director Megan Soll. The box includes ten wildly unique flavors (black fig and pistachio, edamame sea salt, and orange blossom espresso, to name a few), and the bars are packaged in brilliantly bright paper that evokes a rainbow prism when lined up in the box. Each bar is a full ounce of chocolate, and the cost of the box — gift packaging and all — is under $40.\n\n We particularly like the variety of cacao amounts here, with bars ranging from 47 to 71%. There’s even a 30% white chocolate bar made with cayenne and orange for the perfect balance of spicy, bitter, and sweet. Even sweeter is the mission behind the Jcoco Prism Box: A percentage of each purchase goes to fighting hunger right here in the United States.\n\n Bar size: 3 ounces | Allergens: Made in a plant that processes milk, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, egg, and wheat; some products contain coconut, dairy, nuts, soy, and sesame | Vegan: No\n\n Tony’s Chocolonely is making waves in the chocolate world, not just because of its commitment to ethical sourcing (99% of ingredients are Fairtrade certified), but also because it invests in its employees and the environment: The brand is B Corp certified. \n\n This bar was an editor’s choice for the creamiest dark chocolate bar, owing to the ratio of cacao to cocoa butter. “Even people who don’t generally love dark chocolate seem to love this bar from Tony's Chocolonely because it’s so creamy and not overwhelmingly bitter,” says commerce editor Danielle St. Pierre. It’s dark enough to satisfy fans of bitter and complex flavors, but still super smooth with an impressive meltability.\n\n Bar size: 6.35 ounces | Allergens: Contains soy and may contain milk, egg, wheat, peanut, and tree nuts | Vegan: No\n\n To properly evaluate the chocolate bars, we created a testing protocol that was entirely blind. First, we removed each bar from its packaging and scraped off any identifying marks or branding. Our testers were instructed not to wear perfume or scented products, so as not to influence the sensory experience of tasting the chocolate, and we cleansed our palates with water and saltine crackers between each bar.\n\n We evaluated each dark chocolate bar based on the following metrics:\n\nFood & Wine / Russell Kilgore\n There’s a big range in flavor when it comes to the percentage of cacao in a dark chocolate bar. Some brands consider anything above 50% cacao to be dark chocolate, although for this test we only reviewed 70% and above. The higher a bar’s cacao percentage is, the more bitter it will be — this is in part due to cacao’s inherently bitter flavors, but also because there will conversely be less cocoa butter.\n\n All chocolate bars — except 100% cacao — are sweetened, so you can expect cane sugar on the list of ingredients; in the case of gourmet dark chocolate bars, we recommend steering clear of syrups and alternative sweeteners. You’ll also likely see vanilla on the list of ingredients; this is used as a subtle flavoring agent. Be sure the bar you choose is made with pure vanilla extract or real vanilla beans, rather than vanilla flavoring. \n\n Many high-end chocolate bars are certified by Fairtrade International, an accrediting organization that ensures farmers, growers, producers, and artisans are compensated ethically for their time, labor, and product. As with the “organic” classification, goods can be produced ethically and with fair or direct trading practices, but they lack the official label. Regardless, check the chocolate bar’s packaging before buying: If the company practices ethical sourcing, it should indicate that on the bar.\n\n All the bars we reviewed here are made primarily for snacking; you can eat them straight out of the package. Baking chocolate usually (though not always) contains less sugar; in the case of “baker’s chocolate,” it’s 100% cacao. This is because it’s meant to be added to a recipe that already contains a sweetening agent, like granulated and brown sugar in the case of chocolate chip cookies. On that note, baking chips and discs contain stabilizers that help them hold their shape in a hot oven. You can use most snacking chocolates for baking — just chop them roughly with a knife — but be aware their sugar content may alter the overall flavor of your finished product.\n\nFood & Wine/Russell Kilgore\n“Dark chocolate is made from cocoa, or cacao, which is the dried and fully fermented fatty seed of the fruit of the cocoa tree,” says Jamie Vespa, a Registered Dietitian and the recipe developer behind Dishing Out Health. “Dark chocolate has a higher percentage of cocoa solids (50-90%) compared to milk chocolate, and no added milk solids.”\nVespa says that compared to milk chocolate, dark chocolate contains less sugar and has more beneficial minerals and polyphenols; notably flavonoids, which can have anti-inflammatory qualities and may improve vascular function and lower stress. Vespa says, “One ounce of dark chocolate can contain anywhere from 10-20% DV of manganese, magnesium, copper, and iron,” and adds that a 1-ounce serving of dark chocolate with at least 70% cacao is the best way to reap the health benefits.\nYes, although it won’t get you as amped as that afternoon cup of coffee. “Caffeine is present in small amounts (about 0.2% by weight) in dark chocolate,” says Vespa. “It also contains a compound called Theobromine, which has antioxidant activity similar to caffeine, and a mild stimulant effect.”\nHigh-quality dark chocolate bars tend to be naturally dairy-free, made of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar. Nontraditional flavors may include dairy, such as brown butter, so you'll want to read the ingredients list. Lower-quality brands like Hershey’s and Dove often contain milk fat.\nAfter a 2022 Consumer Reports article (updated in 2023) shared findings of cadmium and lead in household chocolate brands, there’s been a greater awareness among chocolate fans about the potentially harmful effects of eating dark chocolate. Says Vespa, “As with many other food products that may contain trace metal contamination, moderation is key,” adding that, “for pregnant persons and young children, it may be best to choose only those brands found to be lower in lead and cadmium by the Consumer Reports article.”\n Endangered Species Dark Chocolate Bold + Silky 72% ($20/6 bars at Thrive Market)The Endangered Species chocolate brand is found in most well-stocked grocery stores, and retails for around $4 per bar, making it a great deal for an impulse chocolate fix. In our review, we were impressed by the very clean, strong snap of the bar, and liked the “classic chocolate” flavor that wouldn’t likely rock anyone’s boat. But some of us found the aftertaste unpleasantly tannic and the texture gritty. It’s a solid bar, but not quite as special as our top picks.Beyond Good Organic 70% Madagascar Dark Chocolate Bar ($12 at Amazon)At 70%, this is one of the lowest cacao percentage bars we tested. The initial appearance of this bar underwhelmed us; we described it as being “dusty,” “dull,” and “crystallized,” with “an opaque cloudy coating.” It has an almost overwhelmingly savory flavor, which many tasters found interesting (and reminiscent of ingredients like bay leaves and soy sauce). The short finish and bitter, slightly over-roasted flavor ultimately knocked this one off the list.Equal Exchange Organic Very Dark Chocolate, 71% Cacao ($36/6 bars at Amazon)With a name like “Equal Exchange,” this bar wears its ethical sourcing accolades on its sleeve (or rather, wrapper), but it fell short in other important ways. We were unimpressed by the chalky, flat finish. The scent was faint and uninspired, reminding us of mass-produced candy bars. Although bitterness and tannins are something we look for in a dark chocolate bar, this one was overwhelming, reminding us of over-steeped tea; there was also noticeable astringency on the finish.Taza Chocolate Bars Deliciously Dark 70% ($50/10 bars at Amazon)Taza is unique among the bars we tasted in that the brand grinds its cacao on a traditional stone mill. The result is a noticeably gritty texture, which didn’t wow all of us. Fans of fruitier chocolate may appreciate this one, as it ranked low on the earthy scale, but we found the texture to be overwhelmingly distracting when evaluating the flavors.TCHO Dark Duo 75% ($47/10 bars at Amazon)Another unconventional pick on our list, TCHO’s Dark Duo contains two types of dark chocolate: The exterior shell is filled with a creamy, fudge-like center. It has a gorgeously glossy finish and a sharp, fruity scent that will appeal to some, but the ganache-adjacent texture was a bit too far afield from traditional bar textures for us to declare it a winner. Although it’s not quite what we were looking for in this test, if you’re in the mood for a truffle, this fancied-up bar will hit the spot\n\n Rochelle Bilow is a food writer and editor with over a decade of professional experience.

If you're assessing your options, you've come to the right place. We've been reviewing smartwatches since the days of Pebble more than a decade ago, and we test options from brands big and small, with a variety of prices and features to help you find a model that fits your budget and needs. The Apple Watch Series 9 is our favorite smartwatch overall thanks to its bright screen, unbeatable selection of third-party apps, and accurate fitness tracking. If you're looking for something less expensive, or you have an Android phone, worry not; we have you covered with our list of the best smartwatches below. Read on for our top picks and buying advice to find the right watch for you.\n\n*Deals are selected by our commerce team\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 offers a broad suite of built-in lifestyle, fitness, health, and safety tools, plus the best selection of third-party apps for any smartwatch. The newest version features an impressively bright 2,000-nit display (up from 1,000 nits last generation) for improved outdoor visibility without an impact on battery life. Its new S9 SiC chip enables even more features, like on-device Siri processing, precise directional device finding with the iPhone 15 family, and a double-tap gesture for one-handed operation. With these upgrades, the Apple Watch Series 9 remains the best iPhone-compatible smartwatch for most buyers. \nIf you're in search of a feature-rich smartwatch to stay connected, keep tabs on your health, and track your fitness, the Series 9 is our Editors' Choice winner. It's worth the premium over the Watch SE for its larger screen, always-on display option, and advanced health-tracking capabilities. Just be aware that Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US since Jan. 18, 2024 do not allow for blood oxygen saturation monitoring.\nWith the Series 9, you can choose from a 41mm (small) or 45mm (large) case in aluminum or stainless steel with Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi support, or add cellular connectivity to the mix. Stainless steel and cellular models cost extra. All aluminum Series 9 models paired with a new Sport Loop band are carbon neutral, as denoted by a green leaf logo on the packaging.\nAll three Apple smartwatches on this list require an iPhone Xs or later with iOS 17 or later and do not work with Android handsets.\nThe Galaxy Watch FE offers almost all the same features and a similar design as the Galaxy Watch 7 for less money. It runs Wear OS, which gives you access to all the standard Google apps like Assistant, Maps, Messages, and the Play Store. On the wellness front, the Galaxy Watch FE can automatically or manually track a wide range of workouts and measure heart rate, pace, and VO2 Max, as well as advanced outdoor running metrics like asymmetry and vertical oscillation. It offers a few health features that are not available on the Apple Watch or the Pixel Watch, including overnight snore tracking and body composition measurements. It's surprisingly durable for the price, with an IP68 weather-resistance rating, a 5ATM waterproof rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification.\nIf you want to save money and still get loads of smarts and health tracking, the Galaxy Watch FE is a great value pick. It's compatible with phones running Android with at least 2GB of RAM. It's only available in one small 40mm size, and you can only buy the Bluetooth model for now, but an LTE version is slated to launch later this year for $50 more than the base model. \nThe Fitbit Ace LTE has fitness, gaming, and safety features tailored for kids ages 7 to 11. A built-in arcade forms a central part of the watch's experience, and each game is meant to limit screen time and encourage activity between short rounds of play. The watch tracks floors climbed, light activity, moderate activity, and steps as the child goes about their day, and offers daily quests and a customizable avatar to encourage active play. Even simple features like the activity ring is a customizable animal that celebrates reaching the daily goal with a variety of animations. \nFor parents, the watch has built-in location tracking through GPS and Google Maps, included as part of the monthly subscription that also unlocks LTE service. Kids can use the watch to send texts and make calls, but only to trusted contacts added by the parent through a Google Family Link account.\nThe Fitbit Ace LTE is expensive and essentially requires a monthly subscription. It also doesn't have a camera or track sleep. Check out the Fitbit Ace 3 for simple, more affordable fitness tracking or the Verizon Gizmo Watch 3 for an experience closer to an adult's smartwatch with tracking and some token games. The Ace LTE, though, is unique enough in its offerings to be worth the splurge for parents want to give themselves peace of mind while keeping their child engaged. \nIn the crowded fitness smartwatch market, Garmin's Venu Sq 2 stands out for its practicality. It features a large AMOLED color touch screen with a squarish design that offers better text legibility compared with round models. Battery life is also a strong suit: In testing, the Venu Sq 2 ran for up to nine days between charges with light use. As with the higher-end round Venu 2 series, the second-generation Sq model is a fitness-first wearable with a robust suite of workout- and health-tracking tools, but it also offers some useful lifestyle features, including calendar and weather apps, vibrating alarms, smartphone notifications, and Garmin Pay mobile payment support. \nIf you're looking for a reasonably affordable smartwatch with a focus on fitness, the Garmin Venu Sq 2 is an Editors' Choice winner. It pairs with smartphones running at least iOS 15 or Android 7.0 via the Garmin Connect app, so compatibility shouldn't be an issue. In addition to the base model, Garmin sells a Music Edition for $50 extra that offers onboard storage for up to 500 songs. \nThe Galaxy Watch 7 brings some advanced wellness features to the line, including advanced glycation end products index tracking (AGEs, an indicator of metabolic health), FDA-approved sleep apnea detection, and holistic health insights courtesy of Galaxy AI. It also has an upgraded dual-frequency GPS and support for gestures that let you tap your fingers or turn your wrist to launch an app, take a picture, or silence an alarm. It features a touch bezel for quick scrolling and an aluminum case. It's also durable with an IP68 resistance rating, MIL-STD-810H certification, and 5ATM of water resistance. \nIf you want the best Wear OS smartwatch for fitness and sleep tracking, go with the Galaxy Watch 7. It offers Galaxy AI wellness assessments that aren't available on the more affordable Galaxy Watch FE, along with a larger screen and slimmer bezels. It comes in small (40mm) or large (44mm) sizes, with two color options for each (green or cream for the small version and green or silver for the bigger one) and two connectivity options (with or without LTE), thus accommodating a wide range of buyers. If you want a more durable version with a titanium body, check out the Galaxy Watch Ultra. The Galaxy Watch 7 series is exclusive to Android phones. Although you can pair it with non-Samsung Android phones, some features, including irregular heart rhythm notifications, phone separation alerts, gesture controls, and snoring detection, work only with Samsung handsets. \nThe Watch SE is the least expensive and smallest smartwatch in Apple's lineup. The second-generation model isn't a massive update to the original, but Apple has lowered the price by $30, upgraded the processor, added a new motion sensor for Crash Detection, and changed to a more environmentally friendly back cover. You miss out on an always-on display and a few health sensors (ECG, SpO2, and temperature), but it otherwise offers almost all the other connectivity, safety, and fitness features of the Series 9 for $150 less. \nSafety features include Emergency SOS, Fall Detection, and irregular heart rate and rhythm notifications. Cellular SE models also now support international emergency calling, so you can reach emergency services in more than 120 countries and regions without your phone while traveling. On the health front, we especially like the automatic 20-second handwashing timer.\nThe Apple Watch SE is a solid option for its target audience of first-time smartwatch buyers, children/teens, and older adults. It even supports Apple's Family Setup feature, which enables you to manage the watch for a family member who doesn't have an iPhone. The Apple Watch SE is an excellent budget-friendly pick, but the Series 9 retains our Editors' Choice award for its more robust health-tracking capabilities and always-on display option. That said, Apple has disabled blood oxygen saturation monitoring on Series 9 and Ultra 2 units currently being sold in the US, narrowing the gap between them and the Watch SE, which has always lacked that sensor.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers a more rugged build and longer battery life than its siblings, plus exclusive outdoor adventuring features that can help you stay safe when you veer off the beaten path. The Ultra series represents the most significant design departure for the Apple Watch yet, with a bright orange customizable Action button, a more tactile Digital Crown you can operate with gloved hands, and a completely flat (vs. domed) front crystal for increased durability. It includes Apple's S9 SiC chip, which enables features like on-device Siri processing, precise directional device tracking (with an iPhone 15), and a double-tap gesture.\nThe Ultra comes with cellular connectivity by default and offers noticeably improved call quality thanks to a dual-speaker system and three-microphone array. Other upgrades include a brighter display, improved water resistance, a dual-frequency GPS for greater accuracy in cities and the woods, and a built-in 86dB emergency siren that is audible from up to 600 feet away. For underwater treks, the watch has an EN13319 certification and a depth gauge with a water temperature sensor. \nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is best for endurance athletes, ocean enthusiasts, and anyone else who spends a lot of time in the great outdoors. With a WR100 water-resistance rating, the Ultra 2 is the only Apple Watch suitable for high-speed water sports and recreational diving. It works for recreational dives at depths of up to 40 meters and can function as a dive computer with the Oceanic+ app. It's pricey, though, and people with smaller wrists might not like its bulky design.\nThough it has limited access to apps, the Fitbit Versa 4 is an excellent fitness-focused smartwatch. We appreciate its attractive, comfortable design which offers a few improvements over the last generation, including a slimmer case, a physical button, and a more responsive touch screen. The latest model offers 40 exercise modes, up from 20 last generation. \nMoreover, the Versa line continues to stand out for its affordability and long battery life. In testing, it lasted four days between charges with the always-on display enabled and the screen brightness set to max. In addition to its robust fitness and health capabilities, it has a small but useful selection of lifestyle features, including Amazon Alexa, Google Maps, and Google Pay. On the downside, the Versa 4 doesn't support third-party app downloads, with the exception of watch faces.\nIf you're looking for a smartwatch with support for cellular calling and third-party apps, this isn't it. Instead, the Versa 4 is a strong option for anyone in search of an attractive fitness-focused smartwatch that keeps things simple. If you want even more wellness-focused bells and whistles, including an ECG sensor for heart rhythm assessments and a cEDA sensor for a more robust stress management experience, the Fitbit Sense 2 is an excellent alternative. \nFor activation and setup, Fitbit devices require the Fitbit app, which is compatible with smartphones running at least Android 9 or iOS 15. Fitbit is in the process of migrating its app to Google's authentication platform. At this point, all new users will need a Google account to log into the Fitbit app. Legacy Fitbit users will soon need to migrate their account over to Google's platform to log in, a fairly painless process we detail in our Versa 4 review. \nThe Pixel Watch 2 is noteworthy because it's Google's own smartwatch line and it runs on the Android-friendly Wear OS smartwatch operating system. Aesthetically, it's a breath of fresh air, with a domed face that looks like a drop of water on your wrist. It offers all the preinstalled lifestyle features you expect from a premium smartwatch, including calling/texting, mobile payments, and smart home controls. Offering full Fitbit integration, it's also well equipped for health and fitness tracking, with sensors to monitor your skin temperature and stress responses. And with the Play Store on your wrist, you can customize the watch with a wide range of third-party apps. \nThe Pixel Watch 2 works with most phones running Android via the Google Pixel Watch app, which requires a Google Account to log in. It is not compatible with iPhones. There are no limitations when you use the Pixel Watch 2 with a non-Pixel Android phone. \nWhile the Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 achieves impressive battery life thanks to its ultra-low-power (ULP) display, the OnePlus Watch 2 gets even better results by employing two different operating systems to save power. It uses Wear OS 4 to run third-party apps and other battery-intensive tasks and a proprietary real-time operating system (RTOS) for low-power operations like sending notifications or running background tasks. It lasted an impressive 103 hours in testing in its default smart mode and 69 hours with its always-on AMOLED display enabled. It also has all of the apps and smarts you expect from a Wear OS watch and doubles as a capable fitness and sleep tracker.\nLike other Wear OS devices, you need an Android phone to use the OnePlus Watch 2. If you have a OnePlus phone, the watch will automatically sync weather and alarm apps, but it otherwise functions the same on any handset running Android 8.0 or later. The OnePlus Watch 2 only comes in one large 47mm size and has no LTE option. \nNaturally, the first thing you should consider before you buy a smartwatch is compatibility. We include these details in our reviews of each product.\nAll Apple Watch models run watchOS, Apple's smartwatch operating system, and work only with iOS devices. Apple's latest wearables—the Series 9, the Ultra 2, and the Watch SE— require an iPhone XS or later with iOS 17 or later and do not work with Android handsets.\nThe Galaxy Watch 7 and the Galaxy Watch Ultra run Wear OS 5 with Samsung's One UI 6 interface. They require a smartphone running Android 11 or later. Note that although you can pair the Watch 7 with non-Samsung Android phones, some features work only with Samsung handsets, including irregular heart rhythm notifications, phone separation alerts, gesture controls, and the Camera Controller app. \nGoogle's Pixel Watch 2 runs Wear OS 4 and works with most phones running Android 9.0 or newer via the Google Pixel Watch app, which requires a Google Account to log in. It's not exclusive to Pixel phones and should pair just fine with devices from any other Android phone maker, including Samsung.\nMost of the other smartwatches on this list are compatible with both Android and iOS smartphones.\nWhat separates a smartwatch from a dumb watch? Lots of things, but as smartphones have taught us, apps might be the most important.\nMost of the watches we like feature full-fledged app stores that bring everything from Spotify, Yelp, and—yes, a calculator—to your wrist. Much like smartphones, app availability is a good way to determine which product to get, so make sure to check out the app selection for each watch before you make a final decision.\nIf you're looking for apps, Apple is your best bet. The App Store lets you browse and download third-party watchOS apps directly on the watch, including popular favorites like AllTrails, Calm, Pandora, Peloton, Shazam, Spotify, Starbucks, and Strava, just to name a few.\nThe Apple Watch still has the largest number of high-quality apps and big-name developers, but Google's Wear OS platform is catching up.\nSamsung's latest smartwatches feature popular Google apps like Assistant, Maps, and the Play Store, alongside Samsung's Bixby, Buds Controller, Pay, and more. The Pixel Watch features all the Google standbys, including Assistant, Gmail, Home, Maps, the Play Store, and Wallet.\nOther popular apps available for download via the Google Play Store on Wear OS smartwatches include Amazon Music, Calm, Deezer, Easy Voice Recorder, KakaoTalk, Samsung Internet Browser, SmartThings, Spotify, Stocard, Todoist, and WhatsApp. \nUnless you want a gadget on both of your wrists (not the best look), you should pick a smartwatch that also works as a fitness tracker. Most smartwatches are capable of tracking basic activity, like steps, but you need to pay close attention to additional features.\nMost of the smartwatches on our list feature GPS connectivity, which means they can record your runs without the help of a companion device. Most modern smartwatches also have an optical heart rate sensor that can take continuous and on-demand heart rate measurements. \nFitbit Versa devices are fairly affordable and track plenty of fitness and sleep metrics, but have less in the way of third-party apps, so there are some trade-offs. Look closely and choose a watch that tracks the activities and health metrics you want to monitor. Some smartwatches offer advanced health-tracking features, including the ability to take an ECG and measure your SpO2 level. \nA cellular connection allows you to make calls, send texts, stream music, download apps, and do anything else that requires an internet connection—all without your phone. The cellular Apple Watch Series 9 carries a $100 premium over the base model (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi only), and then you also have to pay for a separate data plan—most carriers charge an additional $10 per month per smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch 7 and the Google Pixel Watch 2 are also available with cellular connectivity.\nWhether this convenience is worth it for you depends on how you plan to use your watch. If you want to stream music while you exercise and leave your phone at home or in the locker room, a cellular connection can certainly come in handy. If you always have your phone on you, however, you can probably save money and skip it.\nYou don't want a smartwatch with good battery life, right? Good, because you're not going to get it. Features like an always-on display and GPS tracking are nice, but they drain battery life quickly. Watches with full-color, smartphone-like displays, like the Apple Watch and Wear OS watches, generally only last about a day on a charge. \nThere are a few exceptions, including the OnePlus Watch 2 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which offer multi-day battery life. In general, you get much better battery life with a Fitbit or Garmin watch. They typically last around six days on a single charge.\nSmartwatches can be very expensive, but that doesn't mean you need to spend a lot of money to get a good one. Yes, the $1,000+ Apple Watch Hermès is sure to draw a lot of attention, but for that price, you could buy five Fitbits. If you're a first-time smartwatch buyer, consider the less-expensive route first in case you wind up not wearing it all that much.\nAs mentioned, all of the models on this list work with Android phones except for the Apple Watch.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is our current favorite for its streamlined design, excellent health and safety features, and useful calling and texting capabilities. Outdoor adventurers might prefer the Galaxy Watch Ultra, which offers a more durable titanium case, an even stronger sapphire crystal glass display, longer battery life, and a few outdoor-specific navigation features. Those on a budget should look to the Galaxy Watch FE for most of the same features at a more affordable price. \nLet's not forget: You're also going to wear this thing. And unlike your Timex, it's probably not going to remain in style for years. Smartwatch design is rapidly changing, so hold out until you find something you actually want to wear. And keep in mind that smartwatches are still gadgets. The coming year is sure to bring new iterations of pretty much every watch on this list, not to mention completely new ones.\nThe battle for wrist real estate is quickly heating up. That's good news for consumers because this pace of innovation is likely to result in more capable—and more stylish—devices. I wouldn't be surprised if this list reads completely differently the next time you see it. But if you're looking for the best smartwatch available today, the options here are the finest we've tested.\nFor more, check out our roundups of the best Android watches and the best Samsung watches.\nAdvertisement\nSign up for Lab Report to get the latest reviews and top product advice delivered right to your inbox.\n\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Our top gear experts have spent years testing hundreds of the best sunglasses for every possible sunny adventure. We've gotten nitty gritty and super specific with our testing, diving deep into cycling shades, sunnies for sports performance, expensive stylish glasses, and budget-minded options. Over the years, we've worn them across the globe and through all kinds of adventures. We've kayaked at the equator, dog sledded at the North Pole, careened down mountain biking trails through the forest, climbed shining granite faces out west, and driven across the entire US and back. Whether you're searching for a pair to keep you protected and stylish or the ones that will stay on your head during your next 100-mile race, we've got you covered.\nDo you have a specific activity in mind for wearing your new shades? Our experts have tested and ranked the best women's sunglasses and the best sunglasses for men — with plenty of unisex pairs, too. In the process, we rounded up the best cheap sunglasses for those on a tight budget. We've also tested the best sport sunglasses for multi-sport disciplines and the top sunglasses for cycling. From the trail to the beach to your best friend's wedding, we're here to help you find the perfect pair.\nThough we didn't test a polarized pair, the Erika is available with polarized lenses in a wide array of frame and lens colors. Their semi-flexible metal bows are comfortable but a bit loose when worn on the top of the head. We were initially concerned that our test pair's grey lenses appeared purple, but we ended up enjoying their added contrast and didn't find them to change color perception. Though these glasses are expensive, they deliver top-tier performance and unusually versatile style across the board.\nIf the Erika is a bit out of your price range, consider the Merry's Polarized Aluminum or the Le Specs Armada. These glasses look and fit similarly, perform well, and come at a much lower price. \nWe have a few gripes about these stellar glasses. First, their look is slightly polarizing. Some of our testers love their vibe, while others found them “too sporty” for formal or casual situations. Second, they're a bit pricey. Still, if you like the look of the Burnet, their top-notch performance is well worth the investment.\nThe younger brother to the Burnet Mid is the Kaenon Rockaway. These sunnies sport the same great lenses with a slightly softer look and a slightly lower price. Dipping much lower in price but with reasonable performance is the Suncloud Mayor. While in a different league, the fit and style are similar enough to give them a similar vibe. \n \nThe glossy finish on the Trail can be a detriment if you often find yourself hot and sweaty, as they are more prone to sliding down the nose. The flattened fronts and medium-sized lenses typical of the wayfarer style leave sizeable gaps around the edges where sunlight can sneak in. Despite these slight drawbacks, we still found much to love about these cool-looking, budget-friendly shades.\nIf you are not into polarization, the Tens Classic is a higher-quality option with a more universal fit. Bonus: the Tens don't come with the stylish but heavy wooden bows. \n \nThe thing to keep in mind is that this is a value purchase, so it comes with some tradeoffs. Most notably, the lower-quality lenses are not nearly as nice, crisp, or strong as the premium models. Another downside to consider regards the frames. Though comfortable, they look a little small on medium to large faces, and the general quality could be better. Once you see the price, these two concerns quickly fade away. The Treeline is an excellent option for anyone looking to maximize their dollars for a pair of polarized, sports sunglasses. They are also available in a women's specific frame.\nThese sunshades certainly have some perks, but we recognize they're not for everyone. Coming in with close to the same coverage and a more modern look are the 100% S2. These have a very different look but offer similar sport-focused performance and protection.\nWe think it's worth noting that the Timber comes with just a simple microfiber bag, providing very little protection. That said, you could always purchase a more protective case. Over years of testing these sunglasses, we noticed that the woodgrain pattern began to rub off in high-traffic spots, such as over the ears. Still, this is a minor flaw for a seriously great-value pair of sunglasses. See our best cheap sunglasses review for other budget-friendly options. \nNot finding your color? Give the Goodr OGs a peak. These shades offer the same classic style and come in seemingly endless color combinations. And with an even lower price point, snag two. \nHowever, if you want just one pair of sunglasses you can wear to the beach or a black-tie wedding, the Rinconcito may not be quite your style. These performance glasses give the wearer a sportier look than average, and they're also one of the most expensive glasses we tested. But if you're after the best protection for water sports, we highly recommend these excellent sunglasses.\nRegarding water performance, the Smith Guide's Choice is a great wraparound alternative. Another well-known water performer is the Native Wells. These sunglasses have a similar look and fit, offer great glare reduction, and come at a lower price. Dipping even lower in price is the KastKing Toccoa, a budget-friendly, water-happy pair of shades you won't hesitate to toss in your creel. \nThis beefiness doesn't come without a cost. The Original Wayfarer is a heavy pair of glasses, tipping the scales at 45 grams — more than double many of the other pairs we tested. Their smooth frames lend to their comfort, but their weight is still very noticeable. As the OG wayfarer style, these glasses slant very far forward, and while the chicness of this is undeniable, it cuts down on their coverage significantly. Still, it's hard to go wrong with this look. \nStyle comes in many forms. The classic look of the Wayfarer is available at lower prices. The Knockaround Paso Robles is a cheaper pick with loads of options and solid performance. If aviators are more your jam, give the Ray-Ban Classic Aviators a peek. Another stylish yet high-performing sport-oriented pair is the Rapha Classic, which is crisp, clean, and ready to tackle everything. \nThis sturdy frame is inflexible and narrow, causing pressure points on our wider-faced testers. And while there's much we love about their colossal coverage, the Sutro is too bulky to fit under lower-profile helmets. But if you wear a higher helmet and have a medium-width head, these are versatile and capable sports sunglasses. \nYou will find similar performance and price in the 100% Speedcraft. It has a sportier look and boosts a slightly sturdier frame. Another contender worth considering is the Oakley Turbine Rotor — the same quality performance but a slightly different vibe. \nThe main problem with the Exciters is the logo — unfortunately, it can come into your view when looking in certain directions. Also, the weight and lack of flex in the overly thick frames gives us cause for concern. But looking beyond these issues, you get a great mix of performance and style in one wild package. \nThe Roka Torino also offers high form and high function. These shades offer a different but equally bold combination of style and performance without the side shades.\nThe Clarke may not be at the cutting edge of any particular fashion or specific function, but our testers of all genders found their timeless shape to work in various situations. Some, but not all, of our testers found minor back reflections around the edges under harsh lighting conditions. There are other pairs we prefer more for specific sports and niche uses, but these are the ones we can never take out of the rotation since they're just so versatile.\nWith a similar style and function, the Tifosi Swank is a great alternative to the Kaenon Clarke, though their lower price point does come with less impressive performance.  \nUnfortunately, the breathable, off-the-face fit of the Wildcat allows more dust into the eyes than some other goggle-like cycling glasses we tested. Riding in front or on a solo ride, it's something we didn't even notice — just when following closely behind a partner in dry, dusty conditions did this become an issue. But unless you frequently ride in those types of conditions, these are the cycling sunglasses we recommend investing in.\nIf you are willing to pay for more coverage, the Smith Pursuit is an impressive pair and worth a look. The Tifosi Sledge, on the other hand, is a great value grab and offers a sportier vibe compared to others in the biking category.\nRead more: Smith Wildcat review\nWe have spent years testing and retesting sunglasses to evaluate which ones are best for specific uses. As detail enthusiasts, we've broken our sunglasses testing into five separate categories of glasses: men's and women's (which both include many unisex models), cheap, sports, and cycling. We have collectively spent thousands of hours wearing and testing these glasses in every possible activity and location we could. We wore them at the equator on the Galapagos Islands, in the sunny Caribbean, and through cloudless Sierra Nevada Mountain hikes. We wore them dog sledding at the North Pole in spring (sun and snow!), mountain biking patchy trails at twilight, running single track through the desert, road tripping across the country, and paddling across hot summer lakes. We've packed these sunnies in checked luggage, tossed them on car floors, pulled them out of the bottoms of backpacks, and rescued them from watery graves. We are sunglass experts. \nAs extensive as our lineup of sunglasses is, our testing bench is equally impressive. Several of our Senior Review Editors lead the charge in testing all the different types of glasses. Maggie Nichols has been wearing glasses since she was four years old and has been a professional backcountry guide for over 15 years. She is obsessed with protecting her eyes as she works and adventures outdoors in some of the sunniest places on the planet, from the African savannah to mountaintops almost 2 miles high. Rob Gaedtke does just about everything there is to do outside. From crushing ironmans and marathons to rafting, climbing, golfing, and snowboarding, he's always on the go with his favorite pair of shades. Jeremy Benson is an obsessive year-round cyclist and author of two outdoor guidebooks. As a former sponsored ski athlete and current outdoor junkie, he has an unbridled passion for the best sunglasses for every adventure. Zach Wick is an avid cycler of all types, having spent 18 years as a competitive road and mountain bike racer. With a background in outdoor product design, he has an eye for top-quality products. Each of our main testers pulled in the help and critical eyes of a host of friends, family, and coworkers to help test and evaluate these sunglasses.\nJust like a great winter coat, the perfect button-down shirt, or an excellent pair of shoes, there are three types of sunglasses: the ones that look good, the ones that work well, and the ones that look good while also working well. While the right pair of sunglasses can bring your whole look up a notch, they're also a very important piece of protective gear that you should never leave home without. \nUV rays damage your eyes as well as your skin. UV exposure can cause cataracts, macular degeneration, and even eye-related cancers. An ever-increasing body of evidence implies we should all protect our eyes better. This is especially true for those who spend extended hours outdoors, additional protection against high-energy visible light (aka HEV light or blue light). Even if you're stepping out into the backyard with the dog, a blast of bright light can be painful and potentially eye-damaging. Reflected light off surfaces like water and snow, pavement, and other objects compound the amount of light your eyes are trying to cope with, making polarized lenses ideal for blocking out this unwanted additional glare. With all the reasons to wear sunglasses quite literally staring you in the face, let's go through how to decide which sunglasses are right for you.\nBefore even considering the style or intended activities you have in mind for rocking your new shades, it's helpful to go over the many materials and features manufacturers put into their products. Understanding each attribute's benefits and best use will help determine if a pair of glasses is right for you. \nBeyond just the material of the lenses, many manufacturers enhance their products with additional coatings. For non-glass lenses, select a scratch-resistant coating. Even if you are an avid case user, plastic lenses easily pick up scratches — from blowing dust or even being wiped on a t-shirt. A scratch-resistant coating is one of the most important features to ensure the continued usability of your sunglasses over time. Hydrophobic and oleophobic coatings are a nice touch, particularly if you plan to use your glasses for more intense activities involving sweat and water. These two coatings help repel water (hydro) and oil (oleo) from your hair, eyebrows, and fingers.\nA mirrored coating on lenses can help reduce additional light from entering your eyes. It can substitute for lenses that lack polarization or even just as a style additive. Anti-reflective coating on the inside of the lenses is less common, but one that we find makes a huge difference for any pair worn slightly away from your face. Without this coating, it's easy to see the reflection of your face or even your eyeball staring back at you. Anti-fog coatings are also uncommon but exceptionally useful for close-fitting glasses you plan to do high-output activities in — like running, hiking, or biking.\nWhile there are many colors you might get your lenses in, the two most common are grey and brown/amber. Grey lenses typically offer minimal color distortion and are often darker than other colored lenses. Brown and amber lenses increase the contrast of what you see, though the exact nature of this increased contrast depends on the specific lens. These often do better in variable and medium light conditions than gray lenses but sometimes suffer in bright conditions. \nSunglass frames are important for more than just their looks. Several attributes help certain types work better in specific situations. If you're looking for lightweight, durable frames, consider getting nylon frames. They offer a great blend of strength and flexibility, which makes them great for high-intensity sports. For more casual uses, other plastic frames — including acetate — boast low weight with high functionality and reasonable durability. Though they're often less flexible than nylon frames, plastic frames cost less and come in an astonishing array of colors. Some use recycled and renewable materials. \nChecking the hinges of your potential new glasses is a very important consideration. Some sports glasses increase their secure fit by having bows that grip more effectively, then offset this added pressure by including flexible hinges. These flex hinges can overextend, helping them to be more comfortable — especially on wider faces — and add durability to the overall frame construction. Even standard barrel hinges deserve some attention. Though they can't overextend, there are better and worse constructions here, too. More barrels generally make a more secure hinge less likely to loosen over time. Five is a good number, though we tested many with just three and a few with seven. No matter how many barrels you end up with, making sure you can get a small screwdriver in there to tighten or loosen them is a must, as they may loosen over time. \nConsider the other touch points of your potential new glasses on your face. All sunglasses will rest on your nose and above your ears, and some may touch your eyebrows or cheeks. If you have a narrow or wide nose, consider sunglasses with adjustable nose pads. On the other hand, if you often place your sunglasses on the top of your head when going indoors and have longer hair, those free-floating nose pads are likely to get caught. If you're looking for sunglasses to wear while you sweat, consider the material used to make the nose pads. Glossy plastic and heavy materials will likely slide on your nose if it's wet. Instead, look for a matte finish, embedded rubber nose pads, and lightweight glasses. And if you're the type of person who often needs to bend the bows of your glasses to get them to fit your head or sit straight on your face, plastic bows are much more challenging to reshape than metal.\nWhen choosing frames, you'll need to consider your face shape to get the desired coverage you want. If you often wear your sunglasses with a hat, you should not consider top-down coverage. But if you find yourself hatless at midday, ensuring you can minimize the space between your eyebrows and your glasses will prove far more comfortable for your eyes. Getting side and bottom coverage to protect your eyes is also important for anyone outdoors. While larger lenses are an obvious fix, smaller lenses can be just as effective with the right frame curvature. Look at the base curve before committing — a higher number means the pair is more curved to fit your face. Your typical pair of gas station or music festival wayfarers is about a base curve of 6. Some fashionable glasses look almost flat, with a base curve of around 4. Sportier models that wrap around your eyes almost as well as goggles typically advertise a base curve of about 8. \nIn a perfect world, you could find a single pair of sunglasses to wear to brunch, on trail runs, touring European cities, and kayaking at sunset. While those sunglasses can exist, depending on your style, it's much more common to have two pairs of sunglasses — one you love to wear when you're dressing up or just lounging around and another with the sports performance you need for your preferred activities. No matter what you're wearing sunglasses for, there are some useful tips to keep in mind while shopping around.\nAre you mostly looking for a solid pair of sunnies for everyday wear? You know, the ones you can put on to drive to the store, hang out at the beer garden, or wear to all those outdoor weddings this summer? Choosing the best everyday sunglasses has much to do with whether you like how they look on your face — but that's not all you should consider.\nWhen investing in a pair of casual shades, regardless of their cost, check if they will protect your eyes. Check that the lenses have 100% UV protection (most do), and consider if you're going to be driving in them or if you live in a place that gets snowy. If that's the case, you'll want polarized lenses to help keep your eyes comfortable no matter how much glare surrounds you. Grey lenses are popular and often block out more light than other color lenses. In contrast, brown/amber lenses enhance contrast and are typically easier to wear in variable lighting conditions, such as partly cloudy days and golden hours. \nIf buying a pair online, read about the frames' size to ensure they fit on your face. Look to testimonials to see how they fit other people's faces to help gauge how they might lay on yours. Consider adjustable nose pads, flex hinges, and overall size. And look into the return policy of whatever pair you choose, just in case you don't like them.\nOnce you have your sunnies in hand, test them thoroughly before the return period ends. Wear them when you're sweaty and do jumping jacks to see how comfortably they stay put. Wear them outside when the sun is directly overhead or coming at you from the side to check if their coverage and fit offer the protection you want. Golden hour — that hour just after sunrise and just before sunset — can be some of the most challenging times of day for sunglasses, so see how yours do. And don't be afraid to return them and try something else if they don't work for you. \nWe have three reviews that cover casual sunglasses: men's sunglasses, women's sunglasses and cheap sunglasses. Below we highlight the overall scores for each of those sunglass categories. Be sure to check out each review for even more details about how each sunglass model compared.\nIf you've got the looks covered, and you're on the hunt for a set of specs for running/climbing/hiking/paddling/golf, etc., there are other considerations you'll want to keep in mind while you search. We highly recommend getting polarized lenses for sports that involve exceptional glare and light exposure, like water sports, snow sports, or climbing. This added layer of protection will lighten the strain on your eyes by cutting out glare from the sun bouncing off of water, snow, or rocks. Consider other light wavelength protection if your chosen sport has you outside for extended hours. HEV or blue light blockage is particularly useful around the water for activities like paddling or fishing. \nCertain lens coatings are helpful for specific sports as well. An oleophobic coating helps reduce oil on the lenses, which is handy for glasses worn close to your face. A hydrophobic coating is useful if you plan to be around the water or splashed a lot, as it helps water droplets to roll more easily off the lenses. If you want to run in your new shades, consider an anti-fog coating to prevent your lenses from clouding too much. A quality anti-reflective coating on the backs of the lenses is something we highly recommend, as it helps reduce back reflection. \nWhen it comes to quality performance from your frames, think less about their style and more about how well they fit and stay put. Many sports-oriented specs have embedded nose pads and even temple grips to help them stay in place. Check their weight to see if they are as light as your intended use requires. Frames made of nylon are often flexible, offering a secure fit. Flex hinges are useful, too, both for possible impact and for comfort over an extended period. Check their base curvature to see how face-hugging your potential new shades will be, and consider the overall size of the lenses to gauge their coverage. If you often wear a hat or helmet while you're out, keep that in mind when looking at the bow dimensions and lens height of any potential glasses. And, of course, when you get them, put them to the test to ensure they perform how you need them to. \nOur detailed sport sunglasses review scores each model on the key purchase decision metrics. Below we highlight the overall scores of the models we tested. However, we have a lot more detail on those scores in the full reviews. \nIf you need a pair of glasses specifically for biking — whether on the road or the trail — there are a few additional considerations beyond what you might require for other sports. Because you'll have more wind in your face than in many other sports, added coverage is usually a plus for cycling shades. Look for this not just in the size of the lenses, but also their curvature and shape — particularly on the outsides of the lenses and in the center, between your eyes. When considering a close-fitting pair with large lenses, ensure they have an anti-fog coating. Without this added layer, a goggle-like fit will likely start fogging as you sweat your way through your ride. \nIf you're a road biker, lenses with polarization are best to help minimize glare off the road. That said, if you often find yourself riding among the trees, you may not want the polarization, as it can sometimes disguise the rocks and bumps you need to see in the path. For mountain bikers, it can also be advantageous to have two sets of lenses — one meant for bright days with a high VLT and one meant for cloudy or overcast days that offer wind and dust protection without cutting down much, if at any, low light. Some pairs come with two lenses right out of the box, and others offer interchangeable lenses.\nWhen evaluating the frames, try on potential pairs with the helmet you'll wear while riding. Take it to the store if shopping in person. Low-riding helmets can be limiting with cycling shades, which tend to be larger on your face. Be sure to buckle your helmet as you would when riding to see how the straps fit over the bows of the glasses. Check how well they stay secure on your face by jumping. Carefully consider the comfort of the bows over your ears, especially while wearing your helmet, to make sure the fit is just right.\nOur cycling sunglasses review considers all the factors above and more. We detail which models performed best in which metric and how price and value factor in. Below, we chart the overall score of our cycling sunglass test suite, but the full review has much more detail to explore.\nHow can we improve GearLab?
